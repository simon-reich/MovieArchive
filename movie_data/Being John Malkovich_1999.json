He gains employment as a file clerk with LesterCorp, and develops an attraction to his co-worker Maxine Lund, but she does not return his affections.\r\nOne day while filing, Craig discovers a small door hidden behind some filing cabinets. He crawls through it into a tunnel, and suddenly drawn to its other side, where he finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich. After about 15 minutes, Craig is suddenly ejected, and falls back into the real world on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig shows Maxine the door which she initially shows no interest in but later comes up with the idea of selling the experience for profit, calling Craig to set up a business venture. Among those entering the portal is Lotte, and she becomes obsessed with it as it begins to erupt transgender desires. Immediately following this Lotte and Craig go to Dr. Lester's home for dinner where Lotte finds a room filled with John Malkovich memorabilia - she brings this up to Craig who knows of no relationship between the two. Maxine later expresses interest in Lotte but only when inside Malkovich - manipulating Malkovich so that they have sex while Lotte is in his mind and the two continue to conspire further dates inside of Malkovich. Craig, forsaken by both women, locks Lotte in a cage and forces Lotte to set up a meeting with the intent of being John Malkovich during it.\r\nCraig soon discovers that through his puppeteering skills he is able to exert some control over Malkovich and the actor immediately retaliates by disavowing his relationship with Maxine. Malkovich consults with his friend Charlie Sheen who disagrees with John's notion to end the relationship with a 'crazy witch summoning her dead ex-lover,' nonetheless, Malkovich follows Maxine to work and discovers the door; entering it, he finds himself in a world where everyone looks like him and says only \"Malkovich\" before he is ejected. Malkovich demands Craig stop use of the door, but Craig refuses. Instead, Craig discovers he is able to indefinitely stay within Malkovich's mind, and spends the next eight months there, during which he makes Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer and has him marry Maxine, who is pregnant.\r\nMeanwhile, Lotte escapes confinement and warns Maxine of Craig taking her place during her last encounter with Malkovich but Maxine is now more attracted to Craig's control over Malkovich. Lotte contacts Dr. Lester and confronts him about \"being John Malkovich,\" where he explains that the person at the end of the portal becomes \"ripe\" on turning 44, allowing for others to permanently occupy that host's mind and obtain immortality through their consciousness jumping from body to body; after that point, the end of the doorway moves onto another host, a newborn child, and those entering it then will become trapped in that unformed mind. Lester and several of his elderly friends plan to occupy Malkovich from the age of 44 until Maxine's own daughter ages to the same age. Lotte warns them about Craig's current control of Malkovich, and with Malkovich's 44th birthday soon approaching, Lester makes a deal with Maxine to get back at Craig. Lester's group fakes Maxine's kidnapping, and call Craig via Malkovich to demand he leave or they will kill Maxine, but Craig initially refuses. Lotte loses hope and attempts to kill Maxine at the doorway; they both fall through, falling into Malkovich's shame-ridden subconscious before being ejected. Maxine pleads with Lotte that her child was from when Lotte had been in Malkovich's mind, and Maxine had kept it to show her love for Lotte. The two cement their love for each other.\r\nCraig comes to believe Maxine is in danger and voluntarily leaves Malkovich's mind, which Lester and his friends then enter. Craig finds Maxine romantically engaged with Lotte, and decides to get revenge and reenters the door to take back Malkovich's mind. However, too late, he finds that the end of the doorway has passed on, and Craig finds himself trapped in the mind of a newborn girl.\r\nSeven years later, an elderly Malkovich tells Sheen about his plan to extend their lives via the door which leads to the mind of Emily, Maxine's child and whom Craig is permanently trapped in, forced to watch Lotte and Maxine living happily together.\r\nCast\r\nJohn Cusack as Craig Schwartz\r\nCameron Diaz as Lotte Schwartz\r\nCatherine Keener as Maxine Lund\r\nJohn Malkovich as John Horatio Malkovich\r\nOrson Bean as Dr. Lester\r\nMary Kay Place as Floris\r\nCharlie Sheen as himself\r\nW. Earl Brown as First J.M. Inc. Customer\r\nCarlos Jacott as Larry the Agent\r\nWillie Garson as Guy in Restaurant\r\nByrne Piven as Captain James Mertin\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nKaufman's idea of Being John Malkovich originated simply as \"a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife.\" Gradually he added further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor \u200b7 1\u20442 of the Mertin Flemmer building; among his first ideas, Malkovich was \"nowhere to be seen\". He wrote the script on spec in 1994 and though it was widely read by production company and film studio executives, all turned it down. Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Spike Jonze.\r\nJonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997. Jonze took the script to Propaganda Films, which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures. Single Cell producers Michael Stipe and Sandy Stern pitched the film to numerous studios, including New Line Cinema, who dropped the project after chairman Robert Shaye asked: \"Why the fuck can't it be Being Tom Cruise?\". Jonze revealed in a September 2013 interview that Malkovich asked him the same question during their first meeting and also relayed Malkovich's attitude after filming commenced:\r\nEither the movie's a bomb and it's got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I'm fucked that way; or it does well and I'm just forever associated with this character.\r\nJonze explained in the same interview that he didn't realize how brave Malkovich's performance in the film was.\r\nWith a budget of $10 million, principal photography of Being John Malkovich began on July 20, 1998, and continued through August. Filming took place primarily in Los Angeles; specific locations included the University of Southern California campus and the Observation Bar on board the RMS Queen Mary.\r\nThe puppets in the film were created by Kamela Portuges and Images in Motion. Phillip Huber animated the puppets. About Huber's puppetry, Jonze has said he was a full-time puppeteer, and controlled his puppets with impressive means, such as using strings and no rods to control them, as well as swinging the puppets on high wires.\r\nCasting\r\nDiaz's make-up artist Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as \"a challenge, to make her look homely.\" The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that \"people weren't going to recognize me.\"\r\nCusack read the film's script after he had asked his agent to present him with the \"craziest, most unproduceable script you can find.\" Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, with which he won the role.\r\nKeener cited Being John Malkovich as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director's previous work. She had heard about Jonze's experience with music videos and took up the part of Maxine although she initially disliked the character and did not feel that she was right for the part. She was subsequently nominated for an Oscar.\r\nKaufman said that there was never another actor in Malkovich's place in the script: \"The screenplay was always \"Being John Malkovich\", even before I had any expectation that John Malkovich would even read the script.\" He chose Malkovich because he believed there to be \"an enigmatic quality about him that works\", though Malkovich was partly chosen because of the sound of his name in repetition. Kaufman explained that \"When we were thinking of alternatives, we found that a lot of them weren't fun to say.\" Jonze's then-father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola was able to contact Malkovich, and Jonze flew with producer Sandy Stern to Malkovich's home in France. Stern said that Malkovich was \"half intrigued and half horrified\" when he first read the script, but he eventually agreed to star in the film.\r\nSpike Jonze makes a cameo appearance as Derek Mantini's assistant; Mantini is billed in the story as the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world and arouses Schwartz's envy. Brad Pitt also has a half-second-long cameo, as a miffed star in the documentary on Malkovich's career, who seems to be on the verge of saying something before the shot ends. Sean Penn appears as himself, a fan of Malkovich's puppeteer work. Film director David Fincher makes an uncredited appearance as Christopher Bing in the American Arts & Culture pseudo-documentary on John Malkovich. Winona Ryder, Andy Dick, and the members of Hanson can be seen in the audience of a Malkovich puppet show.\r\nDistribution\r\nTheatrical release\r\nBeing John Malkovich was given limited release in the United States theatres on October 22, 1999, and opened across 25 screens.

His comments of praise included: \"Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next\" and he also felt that \"Either Being John Malkovich gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" Another top critic Peter Rainer, writing for New York, commented that \"dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun\" in his review, and Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called it \"the most excitingly original movie of the year.\"\r\nMalkovich's performance in Being John Malkovich is ranked number 90 on Premiere's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".",

He crawls through it into a tunnel, and suddenly drawn to its other side, where he finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich. After about 15 minutes, Craig is suddenly ejected, and falls back into the real world on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig shows Maxine the door which she initially shows no interest in but later comes up with the idea of selling the experience for profit, calling Craig to set up a business venture. Among those entering the portal is Lotte, and she becomes obsessed with it as it begins to erupt transgender desires. Immediately following this Lotte and Craig go to Dr. Lester's home for dinner where Lotte finds a room filled with John Malkovich memorabilia - she brings this up to Craig who knows of no relationship between the two.

133 reviews, with an average rating of 8.13/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Being John Malkovich is both funny and smart, featuring a highly original script.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" The film ranked 441st on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time.</p><p>In his review, Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four stars; he would later name it the best film of 1999. His comments of praise included: \"Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next\" and he also felt that \"Either Being John Malkovich gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" Another top critic Peter Rainer, writing for New York, commented that \"dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun\" in his review, and Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called it \"the most excitingly original movie of the year.\"</p><p>Malkovich's performance in Being John Malkovich is ranked number 90 on Premiere's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".</p><br/>"
