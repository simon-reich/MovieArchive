    "plot": "In a dystopian near future, humanity has been ravaged by a mysterious fungal disease. The afflicted are robbed of all free will and turned into flesh-eating 'hungries'. Humankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid children who crave human flesh but retain the ability to think and feel. The children go to school at an army base in rural Britain, where they're subjected to cruel experiments by Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close). School teacher Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton) grows particularly close to an exceptional girl named Melanie (Sennia Nanua), thus forming a special bond. But when the base is invaded, the trio escape with the assistance of Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine) and embark on a perilous journey of survival, during which Melanie must come to terms with who she is.",

Starring Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine, Glenn Close, and Sennia Nanua, the film depicts a dystopian future following a breakdown of society after most of humanity is wiped out by a fungal infection. The plot focuses on the struggle of a scientist, a teacher, and two soldiers who embark on a journey of survival with a special young girl named Melanie.\r\nPlot\r\nIn the near future, humanity has been ravaged by a disease caused by a parasitic fungus transmitted by bodily fluids. The infected have turned into fast, mindless flesh-eaters, referred to as \"hungries\". Mankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid second-generation children who crave living flesh but retain the ability to think and learn. The children are imprisoned by a group of soldiers led by Sergeant Eddie Parks, and go to \"school\" at an army base in the Home Counties, where they are experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell. Helen Justineau is responsible for educating and studying the children. Among them is an exceptional girl named Melanie. Melanie is brought into a lab by Caldwell to be dissected to develop a vaccine for the disease.\r\nWhen the base is overrun by hungries and the lab is breached, Melanie escapes and wanders outside, where soldiers are being violently attacked. She is stunned by what she sees but attacks and bites two soldiers who are trying to restrain Helen. Justineau and Melanie jump aboard an escaping truck with Sergeant Parks, Caldwell and two surviving soldiers, Gallagher and Dillon. The soldiers want to shoot Melanie, but Justineau and Caldwell protect her. Melanie is restrained and muzzled to prevent her from biting the others. Dillon is killed when hungries attack as the group stops for water, and the truck is disabled.\r\nThe group reaches London by foot and make their way through a swarm of dormant hungries using a \"blocker\" gel that masks their scent, rendering them largely invisible. They take shelter in an abandoned hospital for the night. Caldwell reveals that \"second generation\" hungries were discovered after newborns killed their infected mothers by burrowing out of the womb. In the morning, the group realise they have been surrounded by hungries. Melanie, as a second-generation hungry, is ignored by the hungries. She helps the group by leading the hungries away with a stray dog so the group can escape.\r\nAs they progress through London, they come across piles of infected bodies encircling the BT Tower, which has been overgrown by a massive fungal growth. Caldwell explains that the growth contains seed pods which, if released, could release airborne spores that would end Mankind. They take shelter in an abandoned mobile laboratory that was sent into the city earlier by the military authorities.\r\nCaldwell, injured and dying of sepsis, reasons that she can save the human race by sacrificing Melanie to complete her vaccine research in the lab. As the group runs out of food, Gallagher ventures into the city on a supply run but is killed by a tribe of feral children, who have learned to track uninfected people despite the blocker gel. When the rest of the group is surrounded by the feral children, Melanie kills the leader with a bat. The remaining children back off, allowing them to escape.\r\nCaldwell attempts to dissect Melanie upon the group's return to the lab, imploring her to sacrifice herself for Justineau. Melanie comes to the realisation that she is not an experiment, however; her kind, human-fungus symbiotes, will be the future. She escapes and sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to release an immense cloud of spores. Caldwell chases after her but is killed by the tribe of children.\r\nParks leaves the lab in search of Melanie but becomes infected by the spores. He hands Melanie his gun and tearfully asks her to shoot him as he does not want to turn into a hungry. Melanie obliges and shoots Parks as he is about to turn. In the lab, Justineau stands inside the sealed door, watching the spores fall.\r\nThe film ends with a tearful Helen, safe but confined to the sealed mobile lab due to the lethal environment. Outside, the hybrid children of the army base, along with the feral children, sit together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Justineau speaks through a microphone, once again educating them.\r\nCast\r\nGemma Arterton as Helen Justineau\r\nPaddy Considine as Sergeant Eddie Parks\r\nGlenn Close as Dr Caroline Caldwell\r\nSennia Nanua as Melanie\r\nAnamaria Marinca as Dr Jean Selkirk\r\nFisayo Akinade as Private Kieran Gallagher\r\nAnthony Welsh as Private Dillon\r\nDominique Tipper as Private Devani\r\nProduction\r\nThe book and film were written in tandem, with Carey also writing the screenplay, which was placed on the 2014 Brit List, a film-industry-compiled list of the best unproduced screenplays in British film. Colm McCarthy came aboard as director for his first major feature. The movie was originally titled She Who Brings Gifts but was later retitled, matching the book.\r\nOn 23 March 2015, casting was announced for the film. Of whether or not the film would be similar to the novel, Carey stated:\r\nWe went a slightly different way in the movie, especially when it came to point of view. Where the novel moves between the five main characters and lets us see what\u2019s going on in all of their heads, the movie sticks with Melanie all the way. And there are no Junkers in the movie. The base falls to a hungry attack. But it\u2019s a case of two different paths through the same narrative space. The ending is absolutely faithful to the book.\u2014 M.R. Carey, in an interview with Mom Advice\r\nHalf of the film's \u00a34 million budget came from the BFI Film Fund and Creative England, making it the biggest investment that the latter had ever made and one of the largest ever for the BFI.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began on 17 May 2015 in The West Midlands, taking place in Birmingham city centre, Cannock Chase, Dudley and Stoke-on-Trent. Filming lasted seven weeks. Aerial views of a deserted London were filmed with drones in the abandoned Ukrainian town of Pripyat, which has been uninhabited since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.\r\nRelease\r\nWarner Bros. bought the United Kingdom distribution rights, while the film is being distributed in the United States by Saban Films.\r\nReception\r\nThe Girl with All the Gifts received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86%, based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Girl with All the Gifts grapples with thought-provoking questions without skimping on the scares\u2014and finds a few fresh wrinkles in the well-worn zombie horror genre along the way\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nDave Robinson of Crash Landed described the film as a \"tense and intriguing experience\" noting that whilst its final act \"goes a little off the reservation\" the performance of lead Sennia Nanua will \"make you both care and simultaneously feel on edge\" along with the \"smart choices\" in the CGI department to create a \"grounded feel\" that offers clear similarities to 28 Days Later.",

Caldwell reveals that \"second generation\" hungries were discovered after newborns killed their infected mothers by burrowing out of the womb. In the morning, the group realise they have been surrounded by hungries. Melanie, as a second-generation hungry, is ignored by the hungries. She helps the group by leading the hungries away with a stray dog so the group can escape.</p><p>As they progress through London, they come across piles of infected bodies encircling the BT Tower, which has been overgrown by a massive fungal growth. Caldwell explains that the growth contains seed pods which, if released, could release airborne spores that would end Mankind. They take shelter in an abandoned mobile laboratory that was sent into the city earlier by the military authorities.</p><p>Caldwell, injured and dying of sepsis, reasons that she can save the human race by sacrificing Melanie to complete her vaccine research in the lab. As the group runs out of food, Gallagher ventures into the city on a supply run but is killed by a tribe of feral children, who have learned to track uninfected people despite the blocker gel. When the rest of the group is surrounded by the feral children, Melanie kills the leader with a bat. The remaining children back off, allowing them to escape.</p><p>Caldwell attempts to dissect Melanie upon the group's return to the lab, imploring her to sacrifice herself for Justineau. Melanie comes to the realisation that she is not an experiment, however; her kind, human-fungus symbiotes, will be the future. She escapes and sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to release an immense cloud of spores. Caldwell chases after her but is killed by the tribe of children.</p><p>Parks leaves the lab in search of Melanie but becomes infected by the spores. He hands Melanie his gun and tearfully asks her to shoot him as he does not want to turn into a hungry. Melanie obliges and shoots Parks as he is about to turn. In the lab, Justineau stands inside the sealed door, watching the spores fall.</p><p>The film ends with a tearful Helen, safe but confined to the sealed mobile lab due to the lethal environment. Outside, the hybrid children of the army base, along with the feral children, sit together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Justineau speaks through a microphone, once again educating them.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Gemma Arterton as Helen Justineau</li><li>Paddy Considine as Sergeant Eddie Parks</li><li>Glenn Close as Dr Caroline Caldwell</li><li>Sennia Nanua as Melanie</li><li>Anamaria Marinca as Dr Jean Selkirk</li><li>Fisayo Akinade as Private Kieran Gallagher</li><li>Anthony Welsh as Private Dillon</li><li>Dominique Tipper as Private Devani</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>The book and film were written in tandem, with Carey also writing the screenplay, which was placed on the 2014 Brit List, a film-industry-compiled list of the best unproduced screenplays in British film. Colm McCarthy came aboard as director for his first major feature. The movie was originally titled She Who Brings Gifts but was later retitled, matching the book.</p><p>On 23 March 2015, casting was announced for the film. Of whether or not the film would be similar to the novel, Carey stated:</p><blockquote>We went a slightly different way in the movie, especially when it came to point of view. Where the novel moves between the five main characters and lets us see what\u2019s going on in all of their heads, the movie sticks with Melanie all the way. And there are no Junkers in the movie. The base falls to a hungry attack. But it\u2019s a case of two different paths through the same narrative space. The ending is absolutely faithful to the book.\u2014 M.R. Carey, in an interview with Mom Advice</blockquote><p>Half of the film's \u00a34 million budget came from the BFI Film Fund and Creative England, making it the biggest investment that the latter had ever made and one of the largest ever for the BFI.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began on 17 May 2015 in The West Midlands, taking place in Birmingham city centre, Cannock Chase, Dudley and Stoke-on-Trent. Filming lasted seven weeks. Aerial views of a deserted London were filmed with drones in the abandoned Ukrainian town of Pripyat, which has been uninhabited since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.</p><h4>Release</h4><p>Warner Bros. bought the United Kingdom distribution rights, while the film is being distributed in the United States by Saban Films.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>The Girl with All the Gifts received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86%, based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Girl with All the Gifts grapples with thought-provoking questions without skimping on the scares\u2014and finds a few fresh wrinkles in the well-worn zombie horror genre along the way\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>Dave Robinson of Crash Landed described the film as a \"tense and intriguing experience\" noting that whilst its final act \"goes a little off the reservation\" the performance of lead Sennia Nanua will \"make you both care and simultaneously feel on edge\" along with the \"smart choices\" in the CGI department to create a \"grounded feel\" that offers clear similarities to 28 Days Later.</p><br/>"
