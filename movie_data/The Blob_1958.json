The film was originally titled <i>The Molten Meteor</i> until producers overheard screenwriter <span>Kay Linaker</span> refer to the film's monster as \"the blob\". Other sources give a different account, saying that the film went through a number of title changes (the monster was called \"the mass\" in the shooting script) before the makers settled on <i>The Glob</i>. After hearing that cartoonist <span>Walt Kelly</span> had used <i>The Glob</i> as a title for his <span>Pogo children's book</span>, they mistakenly believed that they could no longer use that title, so they changed it to <i>The Blob</i>. Though the budget was set at $120,000 it ended up costing only $110,000.</p><p>The film was only the second feature film directed by <span>Irvin Yeaworth</span>. Filmed in and around <span>Valley Forge, Pennsylvania</span>, principal photography took place at Valley Forge Studios. Several scenes were filmed in the towns of <span>Chester Springs</span>, <span>Downingtown</span>, <span>Phoenixville</span>, and <span>Royersford</span>, including the basement of a local restaurant which is today named Downingtown Diner. For the diner scene, a photograph of the building was put on a gyroscopically operated table onto which cameras had been mounted. The table was shaken and the Blob rolled off. When the film negative was printed in reverse, it appeared to be oozing over the building. <i>The Blob</i> was filmed in color and in widescreen.</p><p>28-year-old Steve McQueen received $3,000 for his starring role. He turned down an offer for a smaller up-front fee in return for a 10% percent share of profits, thinking that the film would never make money; he needed his signing fee immediately to pay for food and rent. However, <i>The Blob</i> ended up a hit, grossing $4 million at the box office.</p><p>The film's tongue-in-cheek title song, \"Beware of The Blob\", was written by <span>Burt Bacharach</span> and <span>Mack David</span> and became a nationwide hit in the U.S., peaking at number 33 on the <span><i>Billboard</i></span> chart on 9 November, 1958. The song was recorded by studio group <span>the Five Blobs</span> (actually singer <span>Bernie Knee</span> <span>overdubbing</span> himself). Though legend has it that the opening novelty song was composed by a young and unknown Burt Bacharach, along with Bacharach's famous songwriting partner, <span>Hal David</span>, David's brother <span>Mack</span> composed the lyrics and by that time Bacharach had already achieved some measure of success when the film was released.</p><p>The background score for <i>The Blob</i> was composed by <span>Ralph Carmichael</span>, who, like Yeaworth, had worked on TV specials for the <span>Billy Graham Evangelistic Association</span>, and supervised by the director's wife, Jean Yeaworth. It was one of just a few film scores that Carmichael wrote. Carmichael also composed the original theme for the film, entitled \"Violence\" on the soundtrack album, which started the film on a serious and frightening note. It was against the director's wishes to replace the original theme song with that by Bacharach/David. However, because the latter encourages audiences to view <i>The Blob</i> as campy fun, it has contributed to the film's enduring popularity.  Both Carmichael's score and Bacharach/David's song were released in 2008 by the Monstrous Movie Music soundtrack label.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Release\">Release</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span data-section=\"4\" class=\"mw-ui-icon mw-ui-icon-element mw-ui-icon-wikimedia-edit-base20 edit-page mw-ui-icon-flush-right\">Edit</span></span></h2><div class=\"thumb tright\"></div><p>Paramount acquired <i>The Blob</i> for $300,000 from Jack Harris and spent another $300,000 promoting it.

While audiences liked it, critics were not as kind. The review in <i><span>The New York Times</span></i> highlighted some of the problems and identified some positives, although Steve McQueen's debut was not one of them. Concentrating on director Irvin Yeaworth's work, \"Unfortunately, his picture talks itself to death, even with the blob nibbling away at everybody in sight. And most of his trick effects, under the direction of Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., look pretty phony\".</p><p>The review continued with, \"On the credit side, the camera very snugly frames the small town background \u2014 a store, a church spire, several homes and a theatre. The color is quite good (the blob rolls around in at least a dozen horrible-looking flavors, including raspberry). The acting is pretty terrible itself, there is not a single becomingly familiar face in the cast, headed by young Steven McQueen and Aneta Corseaut\".</p><p><i><span>Variety</span></i> had a similar reaction, seeing McQueen as the star, gamely  \"giving the old college try\" but that the \"... star performers, however, are the De Luxe color camerawork of Thomas Spalding and Barton Sloane\u2019s special effects\".</p><p>In a discussion with <span>biologist</span> <span>Richard Dawkins</span>, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">astrophysicist</span> <span>Neil deGrasse Tyson</span> stated that among all Hollywood aliens, which were usually disappointing, <i>The Blob</i> was his favorite from a scientific perspective.</p><p>The film <span>review aggregator</span> website <span>Rotten Tomatoes</span> gives the film a 66% approval rating based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.27/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"In spite of its chortle-worthy premise and dated special effects, <i>The Blob</i> remains a prime example of how satisfying cheesy B-movie monster thrills can be\".</p><h3 class=\"in-block\"><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Home_media\">Home media</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span data-section=\"6\" class=\"mw-ui-icon mw-ui-icon-element mw-ui-icon-wikimedia-edit-base20 edit-page mw-ui-icon-flush-right\">Edit</span></span></h3><p><i>The Blob</i> has been released as part of the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Criterion Collection</span> on three formats.

'The one that used to get all the laughs when people repeated it,' recalled Harris, 'was THE GLOB THAT GIRDLED THE GLOBE. We had another one: ABSORBINE SENIOR. I liked that. And, THE NIGHT OF THE CREEPING DREAD. We were really serious about that one, because it was a \u2018tuxedo\u2019 title; THE GLOB THAT GIRDLED THE GLOBE was a \u2018dumb\u2019 title. I love one-word titles, having distributed many of them, so I said, \u2018Let\u2019s call it THE GLOB.\u2019 Finally everybody agreed. We were applying for copyright, and somebody had done a little investigation and found there was a book called <i>The Glob</i>, by Walt Kelly, the cartoonist. I didn\u2019t know any better then.
