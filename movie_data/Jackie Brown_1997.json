When she gets caught by the agents Ray Nicolet and Mark Dargus with ten thousand dollars and cocaine in her purse, they propose a deal to her to help them to arrest Ordell in exchange of her freedom. Meanwhile Ordell asks the 56-year-old Max Cherry, who runs a bail bond business, to release Jackie Brown with the intention of eliminating her. Jackie suspects of Ordell's intention and plots a complicated confidence game with Max to steal half a million dollars from Ordell.",

The film garnered Forster a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Golden Globe Award nominations for Jackson and Grier.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1995 Jackie Brown, a flight attendant for a Mexican airline, makes ends meet by smuggling money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie, a gun runner living in Los Angeles. Ordell is under watch by the ATF, necessitating him to use couriers. When another courier, Beaumont Livingston, is arrested, Ordell assumes Livingston will become an informant to avoid jail time. Ordell arranges for $10,000 bail with bondsman Max Cherry, then lures Livingston into a car trunk and kills him.\r\nActing on information Livingston had already shared, ATF agent Ray Nicolette and LAPD detective Mark Dargus intercept Jackie as she returns to the United States with Ordell's cash and a bag of cocaine (though Jackie was unaware the cocaine was stashed in her luggage). She is sent to a county jail, alerting Ordell that she might become an informant. Having received payment from Ordell, Max retrieves Jackie from the jail and becomes attracted to her. Ordell arrives at Jackie's house to kill her, but she pulls a gun that she has taken from Max's car. She negotiates a deal with Ordell whereby she pretends to help the authorities while smuggling in $550,000 of Ordell's money, enough for him to retire.\r\nFor this plan, Ordell relies on Melanie Ralston, a surfer girl with whom he lives, and Louis Gara, a former cellmate. Unaware of Jackie and Ordell's plan to smuggle in $550,000, Nicolette and Dargus devise a sting to catch Ordell during a transfer of $50,000. Unbeknownst to all, Jackie plans to double-cross everyone and keep $500,000 for herself. She recruits Max to assist and offers him a cut.\r\nOn the day of the transfer, Jackie enters a dressing room in a department store to try on a suit. She has told Ordell she will swap bags there with Melanie, supposedly passing off the $550,000 under the nose of Nicolette, who has been told the exchange will take place in the food court. Instead, the bag she gives Melanie contains only $50,000, and she leaves the rest behind in the dressing room for Max to pick up. Jackie feigns despair to Nicolette and Dargus, claiming that Melanie took all the money and ran.\r\nIn the parking lot, Melanie derides Louis until he loses his temper and shoots and kills her. Louis confesses this to Ordell. Ordell is livid upon discovering most of the money is missing, and realizes that Jackie is the culprit. When Louis mentions that he saw Max Cherry in the store but thought nothing of it, Ordell kills Louis and leaves with the bag. Ordell turns his anger toward Max, who informs him that Jackie is frightened for her life and is waiting in Max's office to hand over the money.

Tarantino initially planned to film either Freaky Deaky or Killshot and have another director make Rum Punch, but changed his mind after re-reading Rum Punch, stating that he \"fell in love\" with the novel all over again. Killshot was later adapted into a film, produced by Jackie Brown producer Lawrence Bender. While adapting Rum Punch into a screenplay, Tarantino changed the ethnicity of the main character from white to black, as well as renaming her from Burke to Brown, titling the screenplay Jackie Brown. Tarantino hesitated to discuss the changes with Leonard, finally speaking with Leonard as the film was about to start shooting. Leonard loved the screenplay, considering it not only the best of the twenty-six screen adaptations of his novels and short stories, but also stating that it was possibly the best screenplay he had ever read.\r\nTarantino's screenplay otherwise closely followed Leonard's novel, incorporating elements of Tarantino's trademark humor and pacing. The screenplay was also influenced by blaxploitation films, but Tarantino stated that Jackie Brown is not a blaxploitation film.\r\nJackie Brown alludes to Grier's career in many ways. The film's poster resembles those of Grier's films Coffy and Foxy Brown and includes quotes from both films. The typeface for the film's opening titles was also used for those of Foxy Brown; some of the background music is lifted from these films including four songs from Roy Ayers's original score for Coffy.\r\nThe film's opening sequence is similar to that of The Graduate, in which Dustin Hoffman passes wearily through Los Angeles International Airport past white tiles to a somber \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and Garfunkel. In Jackie Brown, Grier glides by blue tiles in the same spot on a moving sidewalk in the same direction to a soaring soul music song, \"Across 110th Street\" by Bobby Womack, which is from the film of the same name that was a part of the blaxploitation genre, just like Foxy Brown and Coffy.\r\nCasting\r\nTarantino wanted Pam Grier to play the title character. She previously read for the Pulp Fiction character Jody, but Tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for Eric Stoltz to yell at her. Grier did not expect Tarantino to contact her after the success of Pulp Fiction. When she showed up to read for Jackie Brown, Tarantino had posters of her films in his office. She asked if he had put them up because she was coming to read for his film, and he responded that he was actually planning to take them down before her audition, to avoid making it look like he wanted to impress her. Several years after the release of the movie, Sylvester Stallone claimed that he turned down the role of Louis Gara.\r\nOut of Sight\r\nWhile Jackie Brown was in production, Universal Pictures was preparing to begin production on Out of Sight, directed by Steven Soderbergh in an adaptation of the Leonard novel of the same name that also featured the character of Ray Nicolette, and waited to see whom Tarantino would cast as Nicolette for Jackie Brown. Michael Keaton was hesitant to take the part of Ray Nicolette, even though Tarantino wanted him for it. Keaton subsequently agreed to play Nicolette again in Out of Sight, uncredited, appearing in one brief scene. Although the legal rights to the character were held by Miramax and Tarantino, as Jackie Brown had been produced first, Tarantino insisted that the studio not charge Universal for using the character in Out of Sight, allowing the character's appearance without Miramax receiving financial compensation.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives it an approval rating of 87% based on 83 reviews, and an average rating of 7.46/10. The site's consensus is: \"Although somewhat lackadaisical in pace, Jackie Brown proves to be an effective star-vehicle for Pam Grier while offering the usual Tarantino wit and charm.\" Metacritic gives the film a 64 out of 100 based on 23 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nRoger Ebert rated the film four out of four stars, writing that \"Tarantino leaves the hardest questions for last, hides his moves, conceals his strategies in plain view, and gives his characters dialogue that is alive, authentic and spontaneous.\" He also ranked the film as one of his favorites of 1997. Movie critic Mark Kermode for BBC Radio Five Live lists Jackie Brown as his favorite film by Quentin Tarantino. Film co-star and frequent collaborator of Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson named his character of Ordell Robbie as one of his favorite roles.\r\nBox office\r\nThe film grossed $39.7 million in the North American and $35.1 million in other territories for a total gross of $74.7 million, against a budget of $12 million.\r\nThe film grossed $9.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing 5th at the box office.\r\nControversy\r\nJackie Brown has attracted criticism for its heavy utterance of the racial slur \"nigger\". The word is used thirty-eight times throughout the film, which is the third most in any Tarantino movie, after Django Unchained (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015). During an interview with Manohla Dargis, Tarantino is quoted as saying \"the minute any word has that much power, as far as I'm concerned, everyone on the planet should scream it. No word deserves that much power.\" This usage elicited comments from director Spike Lee. \"'the problem with Jackie Brown,' Lee said, 'I will say it again and again. I have a definite problem with Quentin Tarantino's excessive use of the n-word.'\" Lee later commented, \"I'm not against the word, and I use it, but not excessively. And some people speak that way. But, Quentin is infatuated with that word. What does he want to be made \u2013 an honorary black man? And he uses it in all his pictures: Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs... I want Quentin to know that all African-Americans do not think that word is trendy or slick.\" Lee even went as far as to address his concerns around the excessive inclusion of the word with Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender. Film critic Pascoe Soyurz also found issue with the repetition of the word. Soyurz says, \"I wouldn't necessarily align myself with Spike Lee, but I do have some reservations about a film of this kind coming out at this time. It seems to me there's a kind of culture-vulture feel to it. I'm concerned about the whole 'blaxploitation' thing. Hollywood is a dream factory but it was Hollywood that created some of the most negative images of black people, which had major effects on the way we were perceived around the world.\" He concludes by stating that Tarantino's use of the word \"devalues the word and the word has a lot of significance.\"\r\nTarantino's choice to use the word was defended by actor Samuel Jackson, who plays the role of Ordell Robbie. \"Did they have another name to call the (black) people they were talking about at the time?\" Jackson asks. He goes on to say, \"If you're going to deal with the language of the time, you deal with the language of the time. And that was the language of the time. I grew up in the South. I heard 'nigger' all my life. I'm not disturbed by it.\"\r\nAwards\r\nGrier and Jackson were nominated for Golden Globe Awards (Grier for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Jackson for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy). Forster was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. In 2008, the film was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, ranking in at #215.\r\nAt the 48th Berlin International Film Festival, Jackson won the Silver Bear for Best Actor award.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nThe soundtrack album for Jackie Brown, entitled Jackie Brown: Music from the Miramax Motion Picture, was released on December 9, 1997. The film's score was composed by James Newton Howard.\r\nSongs by a variety of artists are heard throughout the film, including The Delfonics \"La-La Means I Love You\" and \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\", Bill Withers \"Who Is He\", The Grass Roots \"Midnight Confessions\", Johnny Cash \"Tennessee Stud\", Bloodstone \"Natural High\", and Foxy Brown \"(Holy Matrimony) Married to the Firm\". There are several songs included that were featured in blaxploitation films as well, including Bobby Womack's \"Across 110th Street\", from the film of the same name, and Pam Grier's \"Long Time Woman\", from her 1971 film The Big Doll House. The original soundtrack also features separate tracks with dialogue from the film. Instead of using a new film score, Tarantino incorporated Roy Ayers' funk score from the film Coffy.\r\nA number of songs used in the film do not appear on the soundtrack, such as \"Cissy Strut\" (The Meters), and \"Piano Impromptu\" (Dick Walters).\r\nHome media\r\nThe Special Edition DVD, released by Buena Vista in 2002, includes an introduction from Tarantino, an hour-long retrospective interview, a subtitle trivia track and soundtrack chapter selection, a half-hour making-of documentary (\"How It Went Down\"), the entire \"Chicks Who Love Guns\" video as seen in the film, many deleted and alternate scenes, including an alternate opening title sequence, Siskel and Ebert's review, Jackie Brown appearances on MTV, TV spots and theatrical trailers, written reviews and articles and filmographies, and over an hour of trailers for Pam Grier and Robert Forster films dating from the 1960s onwards. The box also includes a mini-poster of the film, similar to the one above, and on the back of that, two other mini-posters\u2014one of Grier, the other of Forster, both similar to the album cover.\r\nAlthough the Special Edition DVD's back cover states that the film is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it was actually shot with a 1.85:1 ratio, the only Tarantino-directed film to date shot in such a format with the exception of his segment in the film Four Rooms, \"The Man from Hollywood\".\r\nOn October 4, 2011, Miramax released Jackie Brown on Blu-ray Disc along with Pulp Fiction. The film is presented in 1080p HD in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. The disc was the result of a new licensing deal with Miramax and Lionsgate.",
            "html": "<h2>Jackie Brown</h2><p>Jackie Brown is a 1997 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Pam Grier in the title role. The film is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel Rum Punch. It is the only feature-length film that Tarantino has adapted from a previous work. The film pays homage to 1970s blaxploitation films, particularly the films Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974), both of which also starred Grier in the title roles.</p><p>The film's supporting cast includes Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, and Robert De Niro. It was Tarantino's third film following Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994).</p><p>Grier and Forster were both veteran actors but neither had performed a leading role in many years; this film revitalized their careers. The film garnered Forster a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Golden Globe Award nominations for Jackson and Grier.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 1995 Jackie Brown, a flight attendant for a Mexican airline, makes ends meet by smuggling money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie, a gun runner living in Los Angeles. Ordell is under watch by the ATF, necessitating him to use couriers. When another courier, Beaumont Livingston, is arrested, Ordell assumes Livingston will become an informant to avoid jail time. Ordell arranges for $10,000 bail with bondsman Max Cherry, then lures Livingston into a car trunk and kills him.</p><p>Acting on information Livingston had already shared, ATF agent Ray Nicolette and LAPD detective Mark Dargus intercept Jackie as she returns to the United States with Ordell's cash and a bag of cocaine (though Jackie was unaware the cocaine was stashed in her luggage). She is sent to a county jail, alerting Ordell that she might become an informant. Having received payment from Ordell, Max retrieves Jackie from the jail and becomes attracted to her. Ordell arrives at Jackie's house to kill her, but she pulls a gun that she has taken from Max's car. She negotiates a deal with Ordell whereby she pretends to help the authorities while smuggling in $550,000 of Ordell's money, enough for him to retire.</p><p>For this plan, Ordell relies on Melanie Ralston, a surfer girl with whom he lives, and Louis Gara, a former cellmate. Unaware of Jackie and Ordell's plan to smuggle in $550,000, Nicolette and Dargus devise a sting to catch Ordell during a transfer of $50,000. Unbeknownst to all, Jackie plans to double-cross everyone and keep $500,000 for herself. She recruits Max to assist and offers him a cut.</p><p>On the day of the transfer, Jackie enters a dressing room in a department store to try on a suit. She has told Ordell she will swap bags there with Melanie, supposedly passing off the $550,000 under the nose of Nicolette, who has been told the exchange will take place in the food court. Instead, the bag she gives Melanie contains only $50,000, and she leaves the rest behind in the dressing room for Max to pick up. Jackie feigns despair to Nicolette and Dargus, claiming that Melanie took all the money and ran.</p><p>In the parking lot, Melanie derides Louis until he loses his temper and shoots and kills her. Louis confesses this to Ordell. Ordell is livid upon discovering most of the money is missing, and realizes that Jackie is the culprit. When Louis mentions that he saw Max Cherry in the store but thought nothing of it, Ordell kills Louis and leaves with the bag. Ordell turns his anger toward Max, who informs him that Jackie is frightened for her life and is waiting in Max's office to hand over the money. Ordell holds Max at gunpoint as they enter the darkened office. Nicolette jumps from a hiding place and kills Ordell.</p><p>The ATF drops the criminal charges against Jackie for her cooperation. Now in possession of Ordell's remaining money and his car, Jackie plans a trip to Madrid. Max declines Jackie's invitation to join her. They kiss goodbye, and she leaves as he takes a phone call. Max cuts the call short as Jackie drives away.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Pam Grier as Jackie Brown</li><li>Samuel L.
