The screenplay, by Jeffrey Boam, is based on the 1979 novel of the same name by Stephen King. The film stars Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Martin Sheen, Anthony Zerbe and Colleen Dewhurst. Walken plays a schoolteacher, Johnny Smith, who awakens from a coma to find he has psychic powers. The film received positive reviews and became the basis for a television series of the same name in the early 2000s, starring Anthony Michael Hall.\r\nPlot\r\nIn the town of Castle Rock, Maine, John Smith, a young schoolteacher, is in love with his colleague Sarah Bracknell. After having a headache following a ride on a roller coaster, Johnny politely declines when Sarah asks if he wants to spend the night with her. As he drives home through stormy weather, he has a car accident that leaves him in a coma. He awakens under the care of neurologist Dr. Sam Weizak. He finds that five years have passed, and that Sarah is now married and has a child.\r\nJohnny soon discovers that he now has the psychic ability to learn aspects of a person's life through physical contact with them. As he touches a nurse's hand, he has a vision of her daughter trapped in a fire. He also sees that Weizak's mother, long thought to have died during World War II, is still alive, and that a reporter's sister killed herself. Johnny's mother has a heart attack and dies after being visited by Johnny in the hospital.\r\nAs news of his \"gift\" spreads, Johnny is asked by Sheriff George Bannerman for help with a series of murders, but he wishes to be left alone and therefore declines. Sarah visits with her infant son and she and Johnny consummate their relationship, though she points out that they will avoid that aspect in the future. Having a change of heart, Johnny agrees to help Bannerman and, through a vision at the crime scene, he discovers that Bannerman's deputy Frank Dodd is the killer. Before they can arrest him, Dodd kills himself. Johnny is then shot by Dodd's mother, who in turn is killed by Bannerman.\r\nA disillusioned Johnny, now barely able to walk, moves away and attempts to live a more isolated life. He takes on tutoring jobs for children, working from home until a wealthy man named Roger Stuart implores him to come visit and tutor his son, Chris. They form a friendship, but Johnny soon receives a vision of Chris and two other boys falling into an icy creek and drowning due to wearing heavy hockey equipment during a game. Despite Stuart's skepticism, Chris believes Johnny and stays home from the game. The other two boys fall in the ice and drown, much to Stuart's shock. Johnny then realizes he has a \"dead zone\" in his visions, where the future is not set, and he can actually change it.\r\nJohnny attends a rally for Greg Stillson, a third-party candidate for the United States Senate, for whom Sarah and her husband volunteer. Johnny shakes Stillson's hand and has a vision of him becoming president and ordering a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union that results in a nuclear holocaust. He seeks Weizak's advice, asking, by way of example, if he would have killed Adolf Hitler if he had the chance, knowing in advance the atrocities Hitler would commit. Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost him his life, but that it will be a sacrifice he is willing to make.\r\nJohnny loads a rifle and takes aim at Stillson at a rally, with Sarah in the audience. His shot misses the target, but Stillson grabs Sarah's baby and holds him as a human shield. When this happens, Johnny refuses to risk hitting the child. In that moment, a photographer snaps a picture of Stillson holding the baby. After Sarah finally gets ahold of her baby, and before Johnny attempts to fire again, he is shot by Stilson's bodyguard. Confronted by an angry Stillson, Johnny grabs his hand to see into his future. He now foresees Stillson's reputation and political ambitions being ruined; after the photograph of his cowardly act is published, Stillson will commit suicide. Johnny lies dying, satisfied that Stillson's career is forever destroyed and the nuclear war he would have incited will not occur. Sarah embraces Johnny and tells him she loves him as he dies.\r\nCast\r\nChristopher Walken as Johnny Smith\r\nBrooke Adams as Sarah Bracknell\r\nTom Skerritt as Sheriff George Bannerman\r\nHerbert Lom as Dr. Sam Weizak\r\nAnthony Zerbe as Roger Stuart\r\nColleen Dewhurst as Henrietta Dodd\r\nMartin Sheen as Greg Stillson\r\nNicholas Campbell as Deputy Frank Dodd\r\nSimon Craig as Chris Stuart\r\nG\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs as Sonny\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nAs King's novel The Dead Zone was released in 1979, Lorimar Film Entertainment began developing a film adaptation. Producer Carol Baum gave the book to screenwriter Jeffrey Boam and asked him to write a screenplay. \"I saw it had great possibilities and agreed to do it,\" Boam said. He developed a script with director Stanley Donen, who left the project before the film had reached production at Lorimar. Lorimar eventually closed its film division after a series of box office failures, and soon after, producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to The Dead Zone. He initially disliked Boam's screenplay and asked King to adapt his own novel. De Laurentiis then reportedly rejected King's script as \"involved and convoluted\"; however, David Cronenberg, who ultimately directed the film, said that he was the one who decided not to use the script, finding it \"needlessly brutal\". De Laurentiis rejected a second script by Andrei Konchalovsky, eventually returning to Boam. The film was finally on track to be made when De Laurentiis hired producer Debra Hill to work with Cronenberg and Boam.\r\nBoam abandoned King's parallel story structure for The Dead Zone's screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, \"King's book is longer than it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was use that episodic quality, because I saw The Dead Zone as a triptych.\" His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's \"triptych\" in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good. \"It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation,\" he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this \"trick ending\" be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.\r\nKing is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story \"improved and intensified the power of the narrative.\"\r\nBefore Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, Bill Murray was considered for the role as it was King's first choice. Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead. Cronenberg also wanted Hal Holbrook to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.\r\nIn addition to Donen, both John Badham and Michael Cimino were also considered to direct.\r\nFilming\r\nShooting started in early January 1983 and took place in the Greater Toronto Area and the Regional Municipality of Niagara of Cronenberg's native Ontario, Canada. The so-called Screaming Tunnel, located in nearby Niagara Falls, Ontario, was also used as the backdrop for one scene. The gazebo was built by the film crew and donated to Niagara-on-the-Lake.\r\nAccording to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD, The Dead Zone was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario which lasted for weeks, creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero temperatures and icy snow-packed terrain, which made for great natural shooting locations, in spite of it being almost too cold for cast and crew to tolerate at times. Canada's Wonderland, a theme park which is 30 km north of Toronto's city limits, was also used as a filming location.\r\nMusic\r\nThe music soundtrack, composed by Michael Kamen, was recorded by The National Philharmonic Orchestra, London at the famous EMI Abbey Road Studios. Michael Kamen conducted the recording sessions; the orchestra was contracted and led by Sidney Sax. This is the only Cronenberg film since The Brood (1979) for which Howard Shore was not composer.\r\nReception\r\nThe Dead Zone received very positive reviews on release. It holds a 91% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, which catalogs both contemporary and modern reviews from 43 critics. The site's consensus reads, \"The Dead Zone combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations\".\r\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars, describing The Dead Zone as by far the best of the half-a-dozen cinematic adaptations of King's novels to that date. He praised Cronenberg's direction for successfully weaving the supernatural into the everyday, and noted believable performances by the entire cast, especially Walken: \"Walken does such a good job of portraying Johnny Smith, the man with the strange gift, that we forget this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as this guy's story.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times referred to the film as \"a well-acted drama more eerie than terrifying, more rooted in the occult than in sheer horror.\"",

The film stars Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Martin Sheen, Anthony Zerbe and Colleen Dewhurst. Walken plays a schoolteacher, Johnny Smith, who awakens from a coma to find he has psychic powers. The film received positive reviews and became the basis for a television series of the same name in the early 2000s, starring Anthony Michael Hall.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In the town of Castle Rock, Maine, John Smith, a young schoolteacher, is in love with his colleague Sarah Bracknell. After having a headache following a ride on a roller coaster, Johnny politely declines when Sarah asks if he wants to spend the night with her. As he drives home through stormy weather, he has a car accident that leaves him in a coma. He awakens under the care of neurologist Dr. Sam Weizak. He finds that five years have passed, and that Sarah is now married and has a child.</p><p>Johnny soon discovers that he now has the psychic ability to learn aspects of a person's life through physical contact with them. As he touches a nurse's hand, he has a vision of her daughter trapped in a fire. He also sees that Weizak's mother, long thought to have died during World War II, is still alive, and that a reporter's sister killed herself. Johnny's mother has a heart attack and dies after being visited by Johnny in the hospital.</p><p>As news of his \"gift\" spreads, Johnny is asked by Sheriff George Bannerman for help with a series of murders, but he wishes to be left alone and therefore declines. Sarah visits with her infant son and she and Johnny consummate their relationship, though she points out that they will avoid that aspect in the future. Having a change of heart, Johnny agrees to help Bannerman and, through a vision at the crime scene, he discovers that Bannerman's deputy Frank Dodd is the killer. Before they can arrest him, Dodd kills himself. Johnny is then shot by Dodd's mother, who in turn is killed by Bannerman.</p><p>A disillusioned Johnny, now barely able to walk, moves away and attempts to live a more isolated life. He takes on tutoring jobs for children, working from home until a wealthy man named Roger Stuart implores him to come visit and tutor his son, Chris. They form a friendship, but Johnny soon receives a vision of Chris and two other boys falling into an icy creek and drowning due to wearing heavy hockey equipment during a game. Despite Stuart's skepticism, Chris believes Johnny and stays home from the game. The other two boys fall in the ice and drown, much to Stuart's shock. Johnny then realizes he has a \"dead zone\" in his visions, where the future is not set, and he can actually change it.</p><p>Johnny attends a rally for Greg Stillson, a third-party candidate for the United States Senate, for whom Sarah and her husband volunteer. Johnny shakes Stillson's hand and has a vision of him becoming president and ordering a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union that results in a nuclear holocaust. He seeks Weizak's advice, asking, by way of example, if he would have killed Adolf Hitler if he had the chance, knowing in advance the atrocities Hitler would commit. Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost him his life, but that it will be a sacrifice he is willing to make.</p><p>Johnny loads a rifle and takes aim at Stillson at a rally, with Sarah in the audience. His shot misses the target, but Stillson grabs Sarah's baby and holds him as a human shield. When this happens, Johnny refuses to risk hitting the child. In that moment, a photographer snaps a picture of Stillson holding the baby. After Sarah finally gets ahold of her baby, and before Johnny attempts to fire again, he is shot by Stilson's bodyguard. Confronted by an angry Stillson, Johnny grabs his hand to see into his future. He now foresees Stillson's reputation and political ambitions being ruined; after the photograph of his cowardly act is published, Stillson will commit suicide. Johnny lies dying, satisfied that Stillson's career is forever destroyed and the nuclear war he would have incited will not occur. Sarah embraces Johnny and tells him she loves him as he dies.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith</li><li>Brooke Adams as Sarah Bracknell</li><li>Tom Skerritt as Sheriff George Bannerman</li><li>Herbert Lom as Dr. Sam Weizak</li><li>Anthony Zerbe as Roger Stuart</li><li>Colleen Dewhurst as Henrietta Dodd</li><li>Martin Sheen as Greg Stillson</li><li>Nicholas Campbell as Deputy Frank Dodd</li><li>Simon Craig as Chris Stuart</li><li>G\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs as Sonny</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>As King's novel The Dead Zone was released in 1979, Lorimar Film Entertainment began developing a film adaptation. Producer Carol Baum gave the book to screenwriter Jeffrey Boam and asked him to write a screenplay. \"I saw it had great possibilities and agreed to do it,\" Boam said. He developed a script with director Stanley Donen, who left the project before the film had reached production at Lorimar. Lorimar eventually closed its film division after a series of box office failures, and soon after, producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to The Dead Zone. He initially disliked Boam's screenplay and asked King to adapt his own novel. De Laurentiis then reportedly rejected King's script as \"involved and convoluted\"; however, David Cronenberg, who ultimately directed the film, said that he was the one who decided not to use the script, finding it \"needlessly brutal\". De Laurentiis rejected a second script by Andrei Konchalovsky, eventually returning to Boam. The film was finally on track to be made when De Laurentiis hired producer Debra Hill to work with Cronenberg and Boam.</p><p>Boam abandoned King's parallel story structure for The Dead Zone's screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, \"King's book is longer than it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was use that episodic quality, because I saw The Dead Zone as a triptych.\" His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's \"triptych\" in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good. \"It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation,\" he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this \"trick ending\" be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.</p><p>King is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story \"improved and intensified the power of the narrative.\"</p><p>Before Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, Bill Murray was considered for the role as it was King's first choice. Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead. Cronenberg also wanted Hal Holbrook to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.</p><p>In addition to Donen, both John Badham and Michael Cimino were also considered to direct.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Shooting started in early January 1983 and took place in the Greater Toronto Area and the Regional Municipality of Niagara of Cronenberg's native Ontario, Canada. The so-called Screaming Tunnel, located in nearby Niagara Falls, Ontario, was also used as the backdrop for one scene. The gazebo was built by the film crew and donated to Niagara-on-the-Lake.</p><p>According to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD, The Dead Zone was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario which lasted for weeks, creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero temperatures and icy snow-packed terrain, which made for great natural shooting locations, in spite of it being almost too cold for cast and crew to tolerate at times. Canada's Wonderland, a theme park which is 30 km north of Toronto's city limits, was also used as a filming location.</p><h4>Music</h4><p>The music soundtrack, composed by Michael Kamen, was recorded by The National Philharmonic Orchestra, London at the famous EMI Abbey Road Studios. Michael Kamen conducted the recording sessions; the orchestra was contracted and led by Sidney Sax. This is the only Cronenberg film since The Brood (1979) for which Howard Shore was not composer.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-text\"><span class=\"ambox-learn-more\">Learn more</span><div class=\"mw-ui-icon mw-ui-icon-minerva-issue-severity-medium-mediumColor mw-ui-icon-element mw-ui-icon-flush-top mw-ui-icon-small\"></div><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs expansion</b>. <small>You can help by <span class=\"external text\">adding to it</span>.</small>  <small class=\"date-container\"><i>(<span class=\"date\">October 2014</span>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Dead Zone received very positive reviews on release. It holds a 91% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, which catalogs both contemporary and modern reviews from 43 critics. The site's consensus reads, \"The Dead Zone combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations\".</p><p>Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars, describing The Dead Zone as by far the best of the half-a-dozen cinematic adaptations of King's novels to that date. He praised Cronenberg's direction for successfully weaving the supernatural into the everyday, and noted believable performances by the entire cast, especially Walken: \"Walken does such a good job of portraying Johnny Smith, the man with the strange gift, that we forget this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as this guy's story.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times referred to the film as \"a well-acted drama more eerie than terrifying, more rooted in the occult than in sheer horror.\"</p><br/>"
