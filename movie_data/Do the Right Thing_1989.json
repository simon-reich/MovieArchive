    "plot": "This film looks at life in the Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn on a hot summer Sunday. As he does everyday, Sal Fragione opens the pizza parlor he's owned for 25 years. The neighborhood has changed considerably in the time he's been there and is now composed primarily of African-Americans and Hispanics. His son Pino hates it there and would like nothing better than to relocate the eatery to their own neighborhood. For Sal however, the restaurant represents something that is part of his life and sees it as a part of the community. What begins as a simple complaint by one of his customers, Buggin Out - who wonders why he has only pictures of famous Italian-Americans on the wall when most of his customers are black - eventually disintegrates into violence as frustration seemingly brings out the worst in everyone.",

It is often listed among the greatest films of all time. In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, in its first year of eligibility, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\r\nPlot\r\nMookie is a 25-year-old pizza delivery man living in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with his sister Jade (Joie Lee). He and his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) have a toddler son named Hector. He works at the local pizzeria, and lacks ambition. Sal (Danny Aiello), the pizzeria's Italian-American owner, has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. His older son Pino intensely dislikes black people, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the neighborhood, which is increasingly majority African-American, and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.\r\nMany distinctive residents are introduced, including Da Mayor , a friendly drunk; Mother Sister (Ruby Dee), who watches the neighborhood from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy on his boombox wherever he goes; and Smiley, a mentally disabled man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\r\nWhile at Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out, known for trouble-making and b-boying, questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on \"The Wall of Fame\". Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him.\r\nDuring the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, although the latter's favorite celebrities are black. Various characters express flowery racial insults to the camera: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie against Koreans, white police officer Gary Long against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny (Steve Park) against Jews. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his contempt for African Americans, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal.\r\nThat night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons \"guineas\", and threatens to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Frustrated and angry after being called a \"guinea bastard\" and threatened by Buggin' Out, Sal calls Buggin' Out a \"nigger\" and destroys Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat.\r\nRaheem attacks Sal, leading to a violent fight that spills out into the street, and attracts a crowd. The brawl gets so bad, the police are called. While Raheem is choking Sal, the police arrive. They break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of fellow officers and onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of witnesses, the officers place his body in the back of a squad car and drive off, leaving Sal, Pino, and Vito unprotected.\r\nThe onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the restaurant and destroy it. Smiley finally sets it on fire, diverting violent revenge against Sal. Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After police issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.\r\nThe next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal. He feels that Mookie had betrayed him. Mookie demands his weekly pay, which leads to an argument. The two men cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, a local DJ, dedicates a song to Radio Raheem.\r\nThe film ends with two quotations that express different views about violence, one by Martin Luther King and one by Malcolm X. It fades to a photograph of the two leaders shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of police brutality or racial violence: Eleanor Bumpurs, Michael Griffith, Arthur Miller, Jr., Edmund Perry, Yvonne Smallwood, and Michael Stewart.\r\nCast\r\nSpike Lee as Mookie\r\nDanny Aiello as Sal\r\nOssie Davis as Da Mayor\r\nRuby Dee as Mother Sister\r\nGiancarlo Esposito as Buggin' Out\r\nBill Nunn as Radio Raheem\r\nJohn Turturro as Pino\r\nRichard Edson as Vito\r\nRoger Guenveur Smith as Smiley\r\nRosie Perez as Tina\r\nJoie Lee as Jade\r\nSteve White as Ahmad\r\nMartin Lawrence as Cee\r\nLeonard L. Thomas as Punchy\r\nChrista Rivers as Ella\r\nRobin Harris as Sweet Dick Willie\r\nPaul Benjamin as ML\r\nFrankie Faison as Coconut Sid\r\nSamuel L. Jackson as Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy (credited as Sam Jackson)\r\nSteve Park as Sonny\r\nRick Aiello as Officer Gary Long\r\nMiguel Sandoval as Officer Mark Ponte\r\nLuis Antonio Ramos as Stevie\r\nJohn Savage as Clifton\r\nFrank Vincent as Charlie\r\nRichard Parnell Habersham as Eddie Lovell\r\nGinny Yang as Kim\r\nNicholas Turturro as Extra (uncredited)\r\nProduction\r\nLee first got the idea for the film after watching the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \"Shopping for Death,\" in which the main characters discuss their theory that hot weather increases violent tendencies. He was also inspired by the 1986 Howard Beach racial incident, in which an African-American man was killed, and the shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs by police. Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.\r\nThe original script of Do the Right Thing ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film. In this version, Sal's comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground, and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant. Lee did not explain why he changed the ending.\r\nCasting\r\nLee campaigned for Robert De Niro to play Sal the pizzeria owner, but De Niro had to decline due to prior commitments. Aiello eventually played Sal and his son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by Roger Guenveur Smith, who was pestering Lee for a role in the film.\r\nFour of the cast members were stand-up comedians: Martin Lawrence, Steve Park, Steve White, and Robin Harris. Lee originally wanted Nunn to play the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem. The acting couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee were friends of Lee's father Bill; they were cast as Mother Sister and Da Mayor. Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.\r\nFilming\r\nThe film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The street's color scheme was altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's crack dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business there. Lee hired Fruit of Islam members to provide security. Jackson later revealed that he spent much of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside.\r\nReception\r\nCritical reception\r\nFilm critics acclaimed Do the Right Thing. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 93%, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, vibrant and urgent without being didactic, Do the Right Thing is one of Spike Lee's most fully realized efforts \u2013 and one of the most important films of the 1980s.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 92 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\", and placing it as the 68th-highest film of all-time on the site.\r\nBoth Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later each ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade (No. 6 for Siskel and No. 4 for Ebert). Ebert later added the film to his list of The Great Movies. According to online film resource They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Do the Right Thing is the most acclaimed film of 1989. New York Times film critic Wesley Morris has called Do the Right Thing his favorite film.\r\nControversies\r\nAfter release, many reviewers protested its content. Some columnists opined that the film could incite black audiences to riot. Lee criticized white reviewers in turn for suggesting that black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture. In a 2014 interview Lee said, \"That still bugs the shit out of me,\" calling the remarks \"outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist.\" He said, \"I don't remember people saying people were going to come out of theaters killing people after they watched Arnold Schwarzenegger films.\"\r\nAn open question near the end of the film is whether Mookie \"does the right thing\" when he throws the garbage can through the window, inciting the riot that destroys Sal's pizzeria. Some critics have interpreted Mookie's action as an action that saves Sal's life, by redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal to his property, and others say that it was an \"irresponsible encouragement to enact violence\". The quotations by two major black leaders used at the end the film provide no answers: one advocates nonviolence, the other advocates armed self-defense in response to oppression.\r\nSpike Lee has remarked that only white viewers ask him if Mookie did the right thing; black viewers do not ask the question. Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the wrongful death of Radio Raheem.

            "html": "<h2>Do the Right Thing</h2><p>Do the Right Thing is a 1989 American comedy-drama film produced, written, and directed by Spike Lee. It stars Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn, John Turturro, and Samuel L. Jackson, and is the feature film debut of Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez. The story explores a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension, which culminates in violence and a death on a hot summer day.</p><p>The film was a commercial success and received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Aiello's portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner. It is often listed among the greatest films of all time. In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, in its first year of eligibility, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Mookie is a 25-year-old pizza delivery man living in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with his sister Jade (Joie Lee). He and his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) have a toddler son named Hector. He works at the local pizzeria, and lacks ambition. Sal (Danny Aiello), the pizzeria's Italian-American owner, has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. His older son Pino intensely dislikes black people, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the neighborhood, which is increasingly majority African-American, and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.</p><p>Many distinctive residents are introduced, including Da Mayor , a friendly drunk; Mother Sister (Ruby Dee), who watches the neighborhood from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy on his boombox wherever he goes; and Smiley, a mentally disabled man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>While at Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out, known for trouble-making and b-boying, questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on \"The Wall of Fame\". Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him.</p><p>During the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, although the latter's favorite celebrities are black. Various characters express flowery racial insults to the camera: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie against Koreans, white police officer Gary Long against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny (Steve Park) against Jews. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his contempt for African Americans, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal.</p><p>That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons \"guineas\", and threatens to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Frustrated and angry after being called a \"guinea bastard\" and threatened by Buggin' Out, Sal calls Buggin' Out a \"nigger\" and destroys Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat.</p><p>Raheem attacks Sal, leading to a violent fight that spills out into the street, and attracts a crowd. The brawl gets so bad, the police are called. While Raheem is choking Sal, the police arrive. They break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of fellow officers and onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of witnesses, the officers place his body in the back of a squad car and drive off, leaving Sal, Pino, and Vito unprotected.</p><p>The onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the restaurant and destroy it. Smiley finally sets it on fire, diverting violent revenge against Sal. Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After police issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.</p><p>The next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal. He feels that Mookie had betrayed him. Mookie demands his weekly pay, which leads to an argument. The two men cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, a local DJ, dedicates a song to Radio Raheem.</p><p>The film ends with two quotations that express different views about violence, one by Martin Luther King and one by Malcolm X. It fades to a photograph of the two leaders shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of police brutality or racial violence: Eleanor Bumpurs, Michael Griffith, Arthur Miller, Jr., Edmund Perry, Yvonne Smallwood, and Michael Stewart.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Spike Lee as Mookie</li><li>Danny Aiello as Sal</li><li>Ossie Davis as Da Mayor</li><li>Ruby Dee as Mother Sister</li><li>Giancarlo Esposito as Buggin' Out</li><li>Bill Nunn as Radio Raheem</li><li>John Turturro as Pino</li><li>Richard Edson as Vito</li><li>Roger Guenveur Smith as Smiley</li><li>Rosie Perez as Tina</li><li>Joie Lee as Jade</li><li>Steve White as Ahmad</li><li>Martin Lawrence as Cee</li><li>Leonard L.

He was also inspired by the 1986 Howard Beach racial incident, in which an African-American man was killed, and the shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs by police. Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.</p><p>The original script of Do the Right Thing ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film. In this version, Sal's comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground, and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant. Lee did not explain why he changed the ending.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>Lee campaigned for Robert De Niro to play Sal the pizzeria owner, but De Niro had to decline due to prior commitments. Aiello eventually played Sal and his son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by Roger Guenveur Smith, who was pestering Lee for a role in the film.</p><p>Four of the cast members were stand-up comedians: Martin Lawrence, Steve Park, Steve White, and Robin Harris. Lee originally wanted Nunn to play the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem. The acting couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee were friends of Lee's father Bill; they were cast as Mother Sister and Da Mayor. Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>The film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The street's color scheme was altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's crack dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business there. Lee hired Fruit of Islam members to provide security. Jackson later revealed that he spent much of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical reception</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-text\"><span class=\"ambox-learn-more\">Learn more</span><div class=\"mw-ui-icon mw-ui-icon-minerva-issue-severity-medium-mediumColor mw-ui-icon-element mw-ui-icon-flush-top mw-ui-icon-small\"></div><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs expansion</b>. <small>You can help by <span class=\"external text\">adding to it</span>.</small>  <small class=\"date-container\"><i>(<span class=\"date\">September 2016</span>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Film critics acclaimed Do the Right Thing. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 93%, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, vibrant and urgent without being didactic, Do the Right Thing is one of Spike Lee's most fully realized efforts \u2013 and one of the most important films of the 1980s.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 92 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\", and placing it as the 68th-highest film of all-time on the site.</p><p>Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later each ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade (No. 6 for Siskel and No. 4 for Ebert). Ebert later added the film to his list of The Great Movies. According to online film resource They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Do the Right Thing is the most acclaimed film of 1989. New York Times film critic Wesley Morris has called Do the Right Thing his favorite film.</p><h4>Controversies</h4><p>After release, many reviewers protested its content. Some columnists opined that the film could incite black audiences to riot. Lee criticized white reviewers in turn for suggesting that black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture. In a 2014 interview Lee said, \"That still bugs the shit out of me,\" calling the remarks \"outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist.\" He said, \"I don't remember people saying people were going to come out of theaters killing people after they watched Arnold Schwarzenegger films.\"</p><p>An open question near the end of the film is whether Mookie \"does the right thing\" when he throws the garbage can through the window, inciting the riot that destroys Sal's pizzeria. Some critics have interpreted Mookie's action as an action that saves Sal's life, by redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal to his property, and others say that it was an \"irresponsible encouragement to enact violence\". The quotations by two major black leaders used at the end the film provide no answers: one advocates nonviolence, the other advocates armed self-defense in response to oppression.</p><p>Spike Lee has remarked that only white viewers ask him if Mookie did the right thing; black viewers do not ask the question. Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the wrongful death of Radio Raheem. Viewers who question the riot are explicitly failing to see the difference between damage to property and the death of a black man.</p><p>Lee has been criticized for his representation of women. For example, bell hooks said that he wrote about black women in the same objectifying way that white male filmmakers write the characters of white women. Rosie Perez, who was in an acting role for the first time as Tina in Do the Right Thing, said later that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film:</p><blockquote>\"My first experience was Do the Right Thing.
