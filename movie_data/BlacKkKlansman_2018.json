    "plot": "In the early 1970s, Ron Stallworth is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs, Colorado police department. Stallworth is initially assigned to work in the records room, where he faces racial slurs from his coworkers. Stallworth requests a transfer to go undercover, and is assigned to infiltrate a local rally at which national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (birth name Stokely Carmichael) is to give a speech. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas, the president of the black student union at Colorado College. While taking Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a corrupt, racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and sexually assaults Patrice..",

It was theatrically released in the United States on August 10, 2018, a day before the first anniversary of the Unite the Right rally.

The American Film Institute also selected it as one of the top 10 films of the 2018, and at the 76th Golden Globe Awards it earned four nominations, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\r\nPlot\r\nThe film starts with footage from Gone with the Wind (1939) of wounded Confederate soldiers lying in the streets of Atlanta, Georgia which transitions to a black-and-white PSA, where a man (named as Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard) comically fumbles a hate-filled screed decrying minorities. The film then jumps to the central plot.\r\nIn 1972, Ron Stallworth is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department. Assigned to work in the records room, he faces racial discrimination from his coworkers. After he requests a transfer to undercover work, he is assigned to infiltrate a local rally where national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (a.k.a. Stokely Carmichael) gives a speech. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas, president of the Black Student Union at Colorado College. While she takes Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and gropes Patrice.\r\nAfter the rally, Stallworth is reassigned to the intelligence division. After reading about a local division of the Ku Klux Klan in the newspaper, he calls posing as white and speaks with Walter Breachway, the president of the Colorado Springs, Colorado chapter, but soon realizes not only did he use his real name, but he also has to go and meet the Klan members. So Stallworth recruits his Jewish coworker, Flip Zimmerman, to act as him to meet the Klan members while he continues to pose as white on the phone. Under the identity of Stallworth, Zimmerman meets Walter, the slightly more reckless Felix Kendrickson (and later his wife Connie), and Ivanhoe, who cryptically refers to an upcoming attack.\r\nCalling Klan headquarters in Louisiana to expedite his membership, Stallworth begins regular phone conversations with Grand Wizard David Duke. Kendrickson suspects Zimmerman of being Jewish and tries to make him take a polygraph test at gunpoint, but Stallworth breaks the Kendricksons' kitchen window to distract them. Stallworth begins dating Patrice, but does not tell her that he is a police officer. After passing information to the Army CID about active duty members, he learns from an FBI agent that two members are personnel stationed at NORAD.\r\nDuke visits Colorado Springs for Stallworth's induction into the Klan. Over the real Stallworth's protests, he is assigned to a protection detail for Duke. Once Zimmerman is initiated, masquerading as Stallworth, Connie leaves the ceremony to place a bomb at a local civil rights rally. The real Stallworth realizes her intentions and alerts local police officers. When Connie notices a heavy police presence at the rally, she puts Felix's backup plan into action and plants the bomb at Patrice's house, leaving it under her car when it will not fit into the mailbox. Stallworth tackles her as she tries to flee, but uniformed officers detain and beat him despite his protests that he is working undercover.\r\nThe bombmaker, Walker, recognizes Zimmerman from a prior arrest, and informs Felix. He, Felix and Ivanhoe arrive and trigger the bomb while Ron is being detained. Not realizing where Connie hid it, they detonate it while next to Patrice's car, with the force of the blast overturning their car, killing everyone in the vehicle. Zimmerman arrives and frees Stallworth, and Connie is arrested. While celebrating the closed case that night with Patrice, Landers arrives and harasses the two, drunkenly (and remorselessly) admitting to his assault on Patrice; Stallworth then reveals he is wearing a wire, before the police chief arrives and arrests Landers for police brutality.\r\nPolice Chief Bridges congratulates the team for their success, but orders them to end their investigation and destroy the records. Stallworth receives a call from Duke, and he reveals to Duke that he is black before hanging up. While Patrice and Stallworth discuss their future, they are interrupted by a knock on the door. Through the window in the hallway, they see a flaming cross on a hillside surrounded by Klan members.\r\nThe film ends with footage from the 2017 far-right Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the car-ramming attack by James Alex Fields killing Heather Heyer, President Trump's speech positing a moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and the anti-fascist counterprotestors, and David Duke's statement afterwards, followed by a shot of an upside-down American flag fading into black and white.\r\nCast\r\nJohn David Washington as Detective Ron Stallworth\r\nAdam Driver as Detective Philip \"Flip\" Zimmerman\r\nLaura Harrier as Patrice Dumas\r\nTopher Grace as David Duke\r\nJasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen as Felix Kendrickson\r\nRyan Eggold as Walter Breachway\r\nPaul Walter Hauser as Ivanhoe\r\nAshlie Atkinson as Connie Kendrickson\r\nCorey Hawkins as Kwame Ture\r\nMichael Buscemi as Jimmy Creek\r\nKen Garito as Sergeant Trapp\r\nRobert John Burke as Chief Bridges\r\nFred Weller as Patrolman Andy Landers\r\nNicholas Turturro as Walker\r\nHarry Belafonte as Jerome Turner\r\nAlec Baldwin as Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard\r\nIsiah Whitlock Jr. as Mr. Turrentine\r\nDamaris Lewis as Odetta\r\nProduction\r\nIn July 2015, screenwriters/co-producers Charlie Wachtel and David Rabinowitz discovered the book Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth. They interviewed Stallworth and wrote a spec screenplay, then pitched the script to producers Shaun Redick and Ray Mansfield. They brought the property to QC Entertainment, which had co-produced the successful 2017 film Get Out. QC again teamed up with Jason Blum's company Blumhouse Productions, and Jordan Peele's company Monkeypaw Productions, to produce the project.\r\nIn September of that year, Spike Lee signed on as director and John David Washington was in negotiations to star. The following month, Adam Driver, Laura Harrier, Topher Grace, and Corey Hawkins had joined the cast. In November, Paul Walter Hauser, Jasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen, and Ryan Eggold joined the cast, with Ashlie Atkinson joining a month later.\r\nFilming began in October 2017. Ossining, New York was one location used in October.\r\nHarry Belafonte appears in the film recounting the lynching of Jesse Washington; according to Lee, he commanded his crew on the day of filming Belafonte's scene to dress to the occasion in suits and dresses to honor Belafonte.\r\nLee ends the film with a tribute to anti-fascist counter-protester Heather Heyer, who was killed on August 12, 2017 in the Charlottesville car attack during the Unite the Right rally.\r\nRelease\r\nOn April 12, 2018, the film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it premiered on May 14. It opened in the United States on August 10, 2018, which was chosen to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Charlottesville rally.\r\nHistorical inaccuracy\r\nAlthough based on a true story, the film dramatizes the events of the book, and the time period has been shifted. Notably:\r\nThe true identity of Stallworth's partner remains secret. He never went public with his story due to his face-to-face interaction with the Klan. The character portrayed by Adam Driver was developed by Spike Lee as a plot device.\r\nThe actual events occurred in 1979; the film is set in 1972.\r\nThe first third of the film is relatively accurate, but the bomb plot in the film was inspired by an unrelated actual KKK bombing.\r\nSome members in the actual KKK chapter had high-ranking military positions. As a result of the investigation, four members of the US military were reassigned. Stallworth later joked they were \"sent to the North Pole\".\r\nThe character Patrice is fictional, Stallworth was dating his future wife at the time of the investigation.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nBlacKkKlansman grossed $49.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $44.1 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $93.4 million, against a production budget of $15 million.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, BlacKkKlansman was released alongside Slender Man and The Meg, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 1,512 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $3.6 million on its first day (including $670,000 from Thursday night previews). It went on to debut to $10.8 million, finishing fifth at the box office and marking Lee's best opening weekend since Inside Man ($29 million) in 2006. It made $7.4 million in its second weekend and $5.3 million in its third, finishing seventh and eighth, respectively.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 417 reviews, with an average rating of 8.29/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"BlacKkKlansman uses history to offer bitingly trenchant commentary on current events\u2014and brings out some of Spike Lee's hardest-hitting work in decades along the way.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 85% positive score and a 67% \"definite recommend\".\r\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, writing: \"It's an entertaining spectacle but the brilliant tonal balance in something like Jordan Peele's satire Get Out leaves this looking a little exposed. Yet it responds fiercely, contemptuously to the crassness at the heart of the Trump regime and gleefully pays it back in its own coin\". For IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of \"B+\" and wrote that it is \"far more frightening than it is funny\", and \"packages such weighty and ultra-relevant subjects into the form of a wildly uneven but consistently entertaining night at the movies\".\r\nA. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, saw the film as both political and provocative in opening up discussion on timely subject matter following Charlottesville. He stated, \"Committed anti-racists can sit quietly or laugh politely when hateful things are said. Epithets uttered in irony can be repeated in earnest. The most shocking thing about Flip's (Adam Driver's undercover detective role) imposture is how easy it seems, how natural he looks and sounds. This unnerving authenticity is partly testament to Mr. Driver's ability to tuck one performance inside another, but it also testifies to a stark and discomforting truth. Maybe not everyone who is white is a racist, but racism is what makes us white. Don't sleep on this movie\".\r\nIn his review for Vulture, David Edelstein found the film to be a potent antidote for previous films which Lee sees as unduly supportive of the racist viewpoint in the past, such as Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. He stated: \"Lee himself has a propagandist streak, and he knows nothing ever sold the message of white emasculation and the existential necessity of keeping blacks down as well as Griffith's 1915 film. It revived the Klan and\u2014insult to injury\u2014is still reckoned a landmark of narrative filmmaking. If there were no other reason to make BlackkKlansman, this one would be good enough\".\r\nFilmmaker Boots Riley, whose feature film debut Sorry to Bother You also premiered in 2018, took to Twitter on August 17 to criticize the film for its political perspective. While Riley called the craft of the film \"masterful\" and cited Lee as a major influence on his own work, he felt that the film was dishonestly marketed as a true story and criticized its attempts to \"make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racist oppression\", when Black Americans face structural racism \"from the police on a day-to-day basis\". In particular, Riley alleged that the film glossed over Stallworth's time spent working for COINTELPRO to \"sabotage a Black radical organization\" and objected to the film's choices to portray Stallworth's partner as Jewish and to fictionalize a bombing \"to make the police seem like heroes\". Lee responded in an interview with The Times on August 24, stating that while his films \"have been very critical of the police ... I'm never going to say that all police are corrupt, that all police hate people of color\".\r\nAccolades\r\nBlacKkKlansman won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. It was subsequently nominated for four Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. Lee was nominated for Outstanding Feature Film by the Directors Guild of America and the producers were nominated for the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture.\r\nThe film was also nominated for four Critics Choice Awards, including Best Picture, seven Satellite Awards, including Best Director for Lee, and is nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for Driver, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, including Outstanding Male Actor for Washington. The American Film Institute also included it in its Top 10 Films of the Year. It was also nominated for Cinema for Peace Most Valuable Film of the Year 2019.\r\nBlacKkKlansman was nominated for six Academy Awards and won Best Adapted Screenplay. Nominations included Best Picture, Lee for Best Director, and Driver for Best Supporting Actor. The film was also nominated for Best Film Editing and composer Terence Blanchard was nominated for Best Original Score.",

I'm never going to say that all police are corrupt, that all police hate people of color\".</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>BlacKkKlansman won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.
