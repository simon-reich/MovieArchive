It appeared on many critics' lists as one of the best films of 2016 and received a 2017 Empire Award nomination for Best Horror, but grossed just $3 million against a budget of $5 million.\r\nPlot\r\nPat, Sam, Reece and Tiger are members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the Pacific Northwest. After their gig is cancelled, local radio host Tad arranges a show through his cousin, Daniel, at a neo-Nazi skinhead bar in the woods outside Portland, opening for NSBM band Cowcatcher.\r\nAfter the show, Pat returns to the green room to retrieve Sam's phone and sees the body of a girl, Emily, who has been stabbed to death by Werm, a member of Cowcatcher. Pat calls the police, but bar employees Gabe and Big Justin confiscate the band's phones and hold them captive in the green room. Gabe pays a skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to the call. He consults with the bar owner and skinhead leader Darcy, who decides to kill the band to eliminate witnesses.\r\nThe band overpowers Big Justin and holds him hostage, taking a boxcutter from his pocket and his pistol. They negotiate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the pistol. Pat agrees, but as he opens the door, Emily's friend Amber realizes it is a trap and shouts. Darcy and his men slash at Pat's arm with machetes until he drops the gun, but he closes the door. Big Justin attacks the band, but Reece chokes him into unconsciousness. When Big Justin surprises Reece by awaking again, Reece chokes Big Justin again and strangles him.\r\nSearching for a way out, the band discovers an underground drug lab, but the only exit is locked from the outside. Arming themselves with improvised weapons, they exit the green room into the empty club, but neo-Nazi Clark unleashes an attack dog, which kills Tiger. Amber and Pat drive the dog away with microphone feedback. Reece flees through a window but is stabbed to death by a skinhead.\r\nPat, Amber, and Sam retreat to the green room. Darcy sends Daniel into the club to kill the band, who Darcy claims murdered Emily. Amber tells Daniel that Werm murdered Emily after discovering Daniel and Emily planned to leave the skinheads. Daniel agrees to help them escape and leads the band into the club, where he is shot dead by the club's bartender. The group kills the bartender and takes his shotgun, but Clark's dog kills Sam. Darcy's men wound Amber, who scrambles back to the green room with Pat.\r\nDarcy sends skinheads Jonathan and Kyle to kill Pat and Amber, and he leaves with the bodies, planning to stage their deaths to appear as if they were killed trespassing. Pat lures Jonathan into the drug lab while Kyle remains in the green room. Amber ambushes and cuts Kyle's throat with the boxcutter, killing him. As Pat fights Jonathan, Amber sneaks up and shoots him. Gabe enters the green room to find his companions dead and surrenders to Pat and Amber.\r\nHolding Gabe at gunpoint, they trek through the woods. When Pat hears Darcy and his men staging the crime scene, he and Amber go after them. Gabe volunteers to go into a nearby farm and call the police. Pat and Amber kill skinheads Clark and Alan. Fleeing, Darcy pulls a revolver from his jacket but is shot dead by Pat and Amber. Their ammunition and energy spent, Pat and Amber sit on the side of the road and wait for the police.\r\nCast\r\nAnton Yelchin as Pat, the bassist of the Ain't Rights\r\nImogen Poots as Amber, Emily's friend and witness to her murder\r\nAlia Shawkat as Sam, the guitarist of the Ain't Rights\r\nJoe Cole as Reece, the drummer of the Ain't Rights\r\nCallum Turner as Tiger, the singer of the Ain't Rights\r\nPatrick Stewart as Darcy Banker, the leader of the skinheads\r\nMacon Blair as Gabe, a skinhead and club employee\r\nMark Webber as Daniel, a skinhead and Tad's cousin in a relationship with Emily\r\nKai Lennox as Clark, a skinhead and attack dog trainer\r\nEric Edelstein as Big Justin, a skinhead bouncer\r\nDavid W.

Saulnier created a short film set in one as part of a 48-hour film challenge in 2007 which involved the supernatural and according to Saulnier was \"Really kind of fun and hammy.\" However, he still wanted a chance to do his green room movie \"the right way\". Although the film features a large amount of violence and what Saulnier calls \"full frontal gore\", he has gone on record as stating that it is not \"sadistic\", and that every act of violence apart from the initiating incident is done with a reason. As such Saulnier made sure that there were no \"gratuitous close ups\" of recently deceased characters.\r\nOn May 22, 2014, it was announced that Broad Green Pictures would finance and produce the film directed and written by Jeremy Saulnier, with Film Science. Anish Savjani, Neil Kopp and Victor Moyers would produce the film. On October 16, Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots joined the lead cast of the film, along with Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner, Joe Cole, Macon Blair and Mark Webber. On October 21, Patrick Stewart was added to the cast to play Darcy Banker, the leader of a violent white supremacist group, while other cast includes Kai Lennox, Eric Edelstein and Taylor Tunes.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in October 2014 in Portland, Oregon. The location for Tad's house was in Astoria, Oregon, on the Oregon coast, and the forest scenes were filmed in the Mount Hood National Forest.\r\nRelease\r\nBox office\r\nOn October 29, 2014, WestEnd Films acquired the international rights to the film. The film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2015. Shortly after, it was announced A24 Films had acquired distribution rights to the film. The film screened on opening night of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, on September 10, 2015.\r\nThe film was originally to open in a limited release on April 1, 2016, before opening in a wide release on April 15, 2016. However, it was moved to April 15, in limited release, and May 13 wide. According to Box Office Mojo, Green Room opened at #30 in its limited release, premiering in 3 theaters, culminating over $87,984. In its official wide release, the film premiered at 777 theaters, taking the #16 rank on opening weekend, and grossing more than $411,376.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Green Room delivers unapologetic genre thrills with uncommon intelligence and powerfully acted \u00e9lan.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Patrick Stewart, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat and Macon Blair's performances and called the film \"a wonderfully nasty, gruesome, jagged-edge gem of a horror film\" that has \"first-rate\" cinematography, set design, soundtrack, and editing. Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail awarded it a full four stars and wrote, \"Jeremy Saulnier (Murder Party, Blue Ruin) continues one of the best streaks in independent horror with this terrifying and inventive thriller.\" Lenika Cruz of The Atlantic said it's \"a tense gore-fest, one that\u2019s as grimy and claustrophobic as the titular room. But scrape off the scum, and you\u2019ll find Green Room full of visual artistry, dark humor, smart writing, and glints of humanity\". Jon Niccum of The Kansas City Star said it \"bleeds authenticity \u2014 from the scraggy look of the performers to the harsh sounds of their environment to the distinctive squalor that becomes the day-to-day life of those traveling together in a cramped van\". IGN awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying, \"This follow-up to the brilliant Blue Ruin pits a rock band against white supremacists with ace, ultra-violent results.\"\r\nJeffrey Bloomer of Slate favorably compared the film's \"genre maturity\", \"amoral survivalism and malleable sense of good and evil\", \"brutal efficiency\" and \"weary humor\" to John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 and praised the cast, writing \"If the world knows any justice then the Screen Actors Guild will remember this cast when it doles out its awards next year\". James Berardinelli concludes the film is \"for anyone who enjoys sitting through 90 tense minutes and feeling the attendant adrenaline rush. It\u2019s like a well-constructed horror movie\" that's \"As intimate as it is unnerving\". Guy Lodge of Variety called it \"a technically sharp backwoods horror-thriller that lacks a human element\". Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it's entertaining but \"less disciplined, less original and less memorable work than Blue Ruin\".\r\nAccolades\r\nTop ten lists\r\nGreen Room was listed on many film critics' top ten lists.\r\n2nd \u2013 Josh Bell, Las Vegas Weekly\r\n3rd \u2013 Nick Schager, Esquire\r\n3rd \u2013 Jesse Hassenger, The A.V.

In its official wide release, the film premiered at 777 theaters, taking the #16 rank on opening weekend, and grossing more than $411,376.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Green Room delivers unapologetic genre thrills with uncommon intelligence and powerfully acted \u00e9lan.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Patrick Stewart, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat and Macon Blair's performances and called the film \"a wonderfully nasty, gruesome, jagged-edge gem of a horror film\" that has \"first-rate\" cinematography, set design, soundtrack, and editing. Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail awarded it a full four stars and wrote, \"Jeremy Saulnier (Murder Party, Blue Ruin) continues one of the best streaks in independent horror with this terrifying and inventive thriller.\" Lenika Cruz of The Atlantic said it's \"a tense gore-fest, one that\u2019s as grimy and claustrophobic as the titular room. But scrape off the scum, and you\u2019ll find Green Room full of visual artistry, dark humor, smart writing, and glints of humanity\". Jon Niccum of The Kansas City Star said it \"bleeds authenticity \u2014 from the scraggy look of the performers to the harsh sounds of their environment to the distinctive squalor that becomes the day-to-day life of those traveling together in a cramped van\". IGN awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying, \"This follow-up to the brilliant Blue Ruin pits a rock band against white supremacists with ace, ultra-violent results.\"</p><p>Jeffrey Bloomer of Slate favorably compared the film's \"genre maturity\", \"amoral survivalism and malleable sense of good and evil\", \"brutal efficiency\" and \"weary humor\" to John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 and praised the cast, writing \"If the world knows any justice then the Screen Actors Guild will remember this cast when it doles out its awards next year\". James Berardinelli concludes the film is \"for anyone who enjoys sitting through 90 tense minutes and feeling the attendant adrenaline rush. It\u2019s like a well-constructed horror movie\" that's \"As intimate as it is unnerving\". Guy Lodge of Variety called it \"a technically sharp backwoods horror-thriller that lacks a human element\". Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it's entertaining but \"less disciplined, less original and less memorable work than Blue Ruin\".</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"Reference(s)\">Ref(s)</abbr></th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"8\">2015</td><td rowspan=\"3\"><span>Neuch\u00e2tel International Fantastic Film Festival</span></td><td>H.R.
