The geographical change doesn't help them to see more eye to eye. Practical joker Winfried annoys his daughter with corny pranks and jabs at her routine lifestyle of meetings and paperwork. Father and daughter reach an impasse, and Winfried agrees to go home to Germany. Enter Toni Erdmann: Winfried's flashy alter ego. Disguised in a tacky suit, weird wig and fake teeth, Toni barges into Ines' work circle, claiming to be her CEO's life coach. As Toni, Winfried doesn't hold back, and Ines meets the challenge. The harder they push, the closer they become. In all the madness, Ines begins to see that her eccentric father deserves a place in her life.",

Following the death of his beloved dog, he decides to reconnect with his daughter, Ines, who is pursuing a career in business consulting. Ines is working in Bucharest, Romania, on an outsourcing project in the oil industry. Consumed by her work, she seems to have little time for her family.\r\nWinfried spontaneously travels to Bucharest and waits for Ines in the lobby of an office complex. After several hours, she finally appears, accompanied by several of her client's board members and on the way to a meeting. Winfried puts on sunglasses and fake teeth as a playful disguise, and approaches the group from the side while hiding behind a newspaper. Ines ignores him, but meets with him briefly after work and invites him to a business reception at the US Embassy.\r\nIn the evening, Winfried and Ines attend the reception, where they meet Henneberg, a German oil company CEO with whom Ines wishes to secure a consulting contract. Ines tries to gain Henneberg's attention, but Henneberg seems more interested in her father. Winfried tells Henneberg that he has hired a replacement daughter because Ines is always busy. To Ines's surprise, Henneberg invites Winfried and Ines for drinks, along with his entourage. At the bar, Henneberg once again brushes Ines aside and makes fun of Winfried.\r\nAfter several days, Ines and Winfried are struggling to get along. Stressed out from work, Ines oversleeps, missing a planned rendezvous with clients, and blames her father for not waking her up. Feeling alienated and unwanted, he leaves in a taxi for the airport. Ines continues with her work as normal, and several days later arranges to meet two female friends at a bar. While Ines and her friends are chatting, a man approaches and introduces himself as \"Toni Erdmann\". The man is clearly Winfried in a wig and false teeth, but Ines does not let on. Her two friends politely engage \"Erdmann\" in conversation; he explains that he is a \"life coach\" and consultant visiting Bucharest to attend the funeral of his friend's turtle.\r\nInes is increasingly frustrated and unfulfilled in her work and personal life, but continues to encounter \"Erdmann\" sporadically at parties or outside her office. At first Ines is angry with her father, and accuses him of trying to \"ruin\" her, but as time goes on she comes to see the value of her father's interventions in her life, and plays along with the ruse. \"Erdmann\" accompanies her on a night out with her work friends, and eventually even accompanies her to a business meeting. In turn, \"Erdmann\" takes Ines to a Romanian family's Easter party, where he forces her into a reluctant performance of Whitney Houston's \"Greatest Love of All\". After singing, Ines promptly rushes off.\r\nBack at her flat, Ines is preparing to host a business team-building brunch to celebrate her birthday. She struggles to zip up her tight dress, realizes her shoes don't match, and attempts to change clothes. The doorbell rings. Instead of redressing, or changing her outfit, she opens the door wearing only her underpants. The first guest is her friend Steph, who offers to help her get dressed. Ines refuses, and when the next guest arrives she spontaneously removes her underpants and answers the door naked, telling her guests that her birthday brunch is a \"naked party\". Each of them reacts differently, with some leaving in disgust while others self-consciously strip. As the party becomes increasingly awkward, Winfried arrives dressed in a full-body Bulgarian kukeri costume. The costume first scares, then amuses, the partygoers, and Winfried soon leaves. Ines follows him. Outside in a public park, they hug, Winfried still in costume.\r\nMonths later, Ines returns to Germany for her grandmother's funeral. She has quit her job in Bucharest and will shortly begin a new one in Singapore. While talking with Winfried in the garden, Ines grabs the fake teeth from his shirt pocket and puts them on. Winfried says he wants to take a photo and goes to get his camera, leaving Ines alone in the garden.\r\nCast\r\nPeter Simonischek as Winfried Conradi / Toni Erdmann\r\nSandra H\u00fcller as Ines Conradi\r\nIngrid Bisu as Anca\r\nLucy Russell as Steph\r\nMichael Wittenborn as Henneberg\r\nThomas Loibl as Gerald\r\nTrystan P\u00fctter as Tim\r\nHadewych Minis as Tatjana\r\nVlad Ivanov as Iliescu\r\nVictoria Cocias as Flavia\r\nIngrid Burkhard as Grandma Annegret\r\nProduction\r\nThe character of Winfried was loosely based on Ade's own father, who wore a pair of fake teeth she gave him as a gag gift to play practical jokes. She was also influenced by the comedian Andy Kaufman's alter ego Tony Clifton.\r\nAde set the film in Bucharest in part because many German companies had begun to do business there at the end of the Communist era, with many foreign consultants sent to \"change the system\" and help businesses turn a profit. \"And I like the new wave of Romanian films right now, too. So it\u2019d be fun to work there.\"\r\nRelease\r\nToni Erdmann had its world premiere at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The film was originally accepted into the festival's less prestigious Un Certain Regard section, but the night before the April press conference Ade and her producer were informed that it had been selected to compete for the Palme d'Or. Shortly thereafter, Sony Pictures Classics and Thunderbird Releasing acquired US, Latin American and UK distribution rights to the film, respectively.\r\nThe film went on to screen at the Filmfest M\u00fcnchen on 23 June 2016; Sydney Film Festival on 15 June 2016; Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on 3 July 2016; Telluride Film Festival on 2 September 2016; Toronto International Film Festival on 8 September 2016; New York Film Festival on 2 October 2016; and the BFI London Film Festival on 8 October 2016.\r\nThe film was released in Germany on 14 July 2016, Austria on 15 July 2016, and Switzerland on 21 July 2016. The film was released in the United States on 25 December 2016.\r\nGenre\r\nCritics have generally described the film as a comedy-drama. Ade said she thought the story \"always had both genres within it, because playing a comedy for, but he\u2019s doing it out of desperation.\" In writing the script, Ade was interested in the film's comedic potential, though she had doubts during the filming. \"Then, when we edited the film, I found that the comedy was even stronger because we took things so seriously. For example, in scenes like the naked party where the boss is standing at the door, it was really necessary in terms of comedy for it to be as existential as possible\" with the \"actor not thinking of it as a comedy.\"\r\nH\u00fcller said that she always thinks \"about how humor works\" and it was this question \"we were asking ourselves during the process. What is it that makes people laugh? What is funny about Toni? I think...desperation...is the origin of comedy.\" Falling out of a chair is \"the oldest joke.\" But even when things don't work, \"you really have to try, seriously. I think that\u2019s what we did \u2014 you never have to play the joke.\"\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nToni Erdmann opened on July 14, 2016, in Germany and was watched by 752,000 domestic viewers that year.

Following the death of his beloved dog, he decides to reconnect with his daughter, Ines, who is pursuing a career in business consulting. Ines is working in Bucharest, Romania, on an outsourcing project in the oil industry. Consumed by her work, she seems to have little time for her family.</p><p>Winfried spontaneously travels to Bucharest and waits for Ines in the lobby of an office complex. After several hours, she finally appears, accompanied by several of her client's board members and on the way to a meeting. Winfried puts on sunglasses and fake teeth as a playful disguise, and approaches the group from the side while hiding behind a newspaper. Ines ignores him, but meets with him briefly after work and invites him to a business reception at the US Embassy.</p><p>In the evening, Winfried and Ines attend the reception, where they meet Henneberg, a German oil company CEO with whom Ines wishes to secure a consulting contract. Ines tries to gain Henneberg's attention, but Henneberg seems more interested in her father. Winfried tells Henneberg that he has hired a replacement daughter because Ines is always busy. To Ines's surprise, Henneberg invites Winfried and Ines for drinks, along with his entourage. At the bar, Henneberg once again brushes Ines aside and makes fun of Winfried.</p><p>After several days, Ines and Winfried are struggling to get along. Stressed out from work, Ines oversleeps, missing a planned rendezvous with clients, and blames her father for not waking her up. Feeling alienated and unwanted, he leaves in a taxi for the airport. Ines continues with her work as normal, and several days later arranges to meet two female friends at a bar.

It's an awkward move because serious career woman Ines is working on an important project as a corporate strategist in Bucharest. The geographical change doesn't help the two to see more eye to eye. Practical joker Winfried loves to annoy his daughter with corny pranks. What's worse are his little jabs at her routine lifestyle of long meetings, hotel bars and performance reports. Father and daughter reach an impasse, and Winfried agrees to return home to Germany.   Enter flashy Toni Erdmann: Winfried's smooth-talking alter ego. Disguised in a tacky suit, weird wig and even weirder fake teeth, Toni barges into Ines' professional life, claiming to be her CEO's life coach. As Toni, Winfried is bolder and doesn't hold back, but Ines meets the challenge. The harder they push, the closer they become. In all the madness, Ines begins to understand that her eccentric father might deserve some place in her life after all..",
