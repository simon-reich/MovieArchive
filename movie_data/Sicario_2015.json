Its sequel, Sicario: Day of the Soldado, was released on June 29, 2018.\r\nPlot\r\nIn Chandler, Arizona, FBI agents Kate Macer and Reggie Wayne lead a raid on a suspected Sonora Cartel safe house, where they discover dozens of decaying corpses and a booby trap which kills two police officers. Following the raid, Kate's boss recommends her for a Department of Justice and Department of Defense joint task force, headed by SOCOM former operator Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick, to apprehend Sonora Cartel lieutenant Manuel D\u00edaz. Assured that the task force will bring those responsible for the safe house incident to justice, Kate joins the operation.\r\nThe team, which includes SFOD-D and CIA operators, travels to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, in order to extradite Manuel D\u00edaz's brother and henchman Guillermo D\u00edaz. Returning to the U.S., the team engage in a shootout with cartel gunmen at the border, killing the gunmen while endangering nearby civilians, shocking Kate. Alejandro tortures Guillermo on American soil and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel near Nogales, Sonora to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Reggie and Kate begin to question the task force's illegal methods, forcing Matt to reveal that their objective is not to apprehend D\u00edaz, but to disrupt his drug operations enough to have Diaz be summoned back to Mexico by his boss: the elusive Sonora Cartel drug lord Fausto Alarc\u00f3n. By following D\u00edaz, they plan to bring Alarc\u00f3n to justice.\r\nLater, the team raids a bank used by D\u00edaz's money launderers and freezes his accounts. Kate and Reggie want to use their findings from the raid to mount a legal case against D\u00edaz, but are ordered to stand down so as not to jeopardize the operation. While commiserating at a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted, a friend and local police officer. Kate invites Ted to her apartment, only to realize he is working with the cartel. Ted tries to strangle Kate, but Alejandro suddenly appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt used Kate as bait, knowing the cartel would target her after she foolishly allowed herself to be seen at the bank raid. Alejandro and Matt coerce Ted into revealing the names of other officers working for D\u00edaz.\r\nThe team soon learn that D\u00edaz is being recalled to Mexico, and prepare to raid the tunnel. Matt further reveals that Kate and Reggie's involvement is simply a technical necessity, as operating with U.S. law officers grants the CIA legal auspice to operate on American soil. Reggie advises Kate that they leave, but she insists on joining the raid to learn more about the operation's true nature. At the Mexican end of the tunnel, Kate witnesses Alejandro kidnapping one of D\u00edaz's drug mules: a corrupt Mexican police officer named Silvio. Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he shoots her in her bulletproof vest to incapacitate her, and then drives off with Silvio. Kate then realizes that Alejandro is operating with the SFOD-D task force to engage and eliminate Alarcon and there was never any plan of bringing Alarcon to justice through legally executed methods.\r\nKate then angrily confronts Matt, who finally explains that the operation is part of an ultimate plan to eliminate all cartel competition, which will result in only a single cartel that the U.S. can easily control. Alejandro, a lawyer who worked for the Medell\u00edn Cartel, was hired to assassinate Alarc\u00f3n as part of this end goal. Alejandro's motives are also personal, as Alarc\u00f3n had ordered the vicious murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter. In Mexico, Alejandro forces Silvio to drive him to D\u00edaz, kills Silvio, and then forces D\u00edaz to continue driving towards Alarc\u00f3n. Reaching Alarc\u00f3n's estate, Alejandro (with the help of the task force's remote surveillance) kills D\u00edaz, the guards, Alarc\u00f3n's wife and two sons in front of him, and finally Alarc\u00f3n himself.\r\nThe next day, Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her at gunpoint to sign a statement confirming that the entire operation was legal. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him, but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger.

According to Sebastian Rotella, an American foreign correspondent and investigative journalist, Sicario examines many aspects of the U.S. War on Drugs against, most generally, drug cartels in Mexico, Central, and South America. He noted that the illegal drug trafficking situation in Mexico has remained largely stagnant in the two decades prior to the film's release and that the film asserts that the American War on Drugs is \"turning us into the very monsters we are trying to defeat.\" Rotella asserted that progress has been made in Mexico, and expressed qualms over the depiction of the film's extralegal \"black ops campaign\", relative to his experience that most U.S. operations resulted in the legal arrest and prosecution of drug lords.\r\nSequel\r\nLionsgate commissioned a sequel centering on del Toro's character, subtitled Soldado. The project was overseen by writer Taylor Sheridan. In April 2016, producers Molly Smith and Trent Luckinbill said del Toro and Brolin would return. In June 2016, Italian filmmaker Stefano Sollima was hired to direct, with Villeneuve no longer available due to scheduling conflicts. Principal photography began on November 8, 2016 in New Mexico. Sicario: Day of the Soldado was released in the United States on June 29, 2018 to generally positive reviews.",
            "html": "<h2>Sicario (2015 film)</h2><p>Sicario (, Spanish for \"Hitman\") is a 2015 American action-thriller film directed by Denis Villeneuve, written by Taylor Sheridan and starring Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin, and Victor Garber. The film follows a principled FBI agent who is enlisted by a government task force to bring down the leader of a powerful and brutal Mexican drug cartel. Sicario was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It began a limited release in the United States on September 18, 2015, followed by a nationwide release on October 2, 2015.</p><p>Sicario received praise for its screenplay, direction, musical score, cinematography, and Blunt and del Toro's performances. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Editing at the 88th Academy Awards. It also earned BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Music. Its sequel, Sicario: Day of the Soldado, was released on June 29, 2018.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In Chandler, Arizona, FBI agents Kate Macer and Reggie Wayne lead a raid on a suspected Sonora Cartel safe house, where they discover dozens of decaying corpses and a booby trap which kills two police officers. Following the raid, Kate's boss recommends her for a Department of Justice and Department of Defense joint task force, headed by SOCOM former operator Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick, to apprehend Sonora Cartel lieutenant Manuel D\u00edaz. Assured that the task force will bring those responsible for the safe house incident to justice, Kate joins the operation.</p><p>The team, which includes SFOD-D and CIA operators, travels to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, in order to extradite Manuel D\u00edaz's brother and henchman Guillermo D\u00edaz. Returning to the U.S., the team engage in a shootout with cartel gunmen at the border, killing the gunmen while endangering nearby civilians, shocking Kate. Alejandro tortures Guillermo on American soil and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel near Nogales, Sonora to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Reggie and Kate begin to question the task force's illegal methods, forcing Matt to reveal that their objective is not to apprehend D\u00edaz, but to disrupt his drug operations enough to have Diaz be summoned back to Mexico by his boss: the elusive Sonora Cartel drug lord Fausto Alarc\u00f3n. By following D\u00edaz, they plan to bring Alarc\u00f3n to justice.</p><p>Later, the team raids a bank used by D\u00edaz's money launderers and freezes his accounts. Kate and Reggie want to use their findings from the raid to mount a legal case against D\u00edaz, but are ordered to stand down so as not to jeopardize the operation. While commiserating at a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted, a friend and local police officer. Kate invites Ted to her apartment, only to realize he is working with the cartel. Ted tries to strangle Kate, but Alejandro suddenly appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt used Kate as bait, knowing the cartel would target her after she foolishly allowed herself to be seen at the bank raid. Alejandro and Matt coerce Ted into revealing the names of other officers working for D\u00edaz.</p><p>The team soon learn that D\u00edaz is being recalled to Mexico, and prepare to raid the tunnel. Matt further reveals that Kate and Reggie's involvement is simply a technical necessity, as operating with U.S. law officers grants the CIA legal auspice to operate on American soil. Reggie advises Kate that they leave, but she insists on joining the raid to learn more about the operation's true nature. At the Mexican end of the tunnel, Kate witnesses Alejandro kidnapping one of D\u00edaz's drug mules: a corrupt Mexican police officer named Silvio. Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he shoots her in her bulletproof vest to incapacitate her, and then drives off with Silvio. Kate then realizes that Alejandro is operating with the SFOD-D task force to engage and eliminate Alarcon and there was never any plan of bringing Alarcon to justice through legally executed methods.</p><p>Kate then angrily confronts Matt, who finally explains that the operation is part of an ultimate plan to eliminate all cartel competition, which will result in only a single cartel that the U.S. can easily control. Alejandro, a lawyer who worked for the Medell\u00edn Cartel, was hired to assassinate Alarc\u00f3n as part of this end goal. Alejandro's motives are also personal, as Alarc\u00f3n had ordered the vicious murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter. In Mexico, Alejandro forces Silvio to drive him to D\u00edaz, kills Silvio, and then forces D\u00edaz to continue driving towards Alarc\u00f3n. Reaching Alarc\u00f3n's estate, Alejandro (with the help of the task force's remote surveillance) kills D\u00edaz, the guards, Alarc\u00f3n's wife and two sons in front of him, and finally Alarc\u00f3n himself.</p><p>The next day, Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her at gunpoint to sign a statement confirming that the entire operation was legal. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him, but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. Back in Nogales, Silvio's widow watches her son's soccer game, which is briefly interrupted by the sound of distant gunfire.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><p>{{Cast listing|</p><ul><li>Emily Blunt as Kate Macer, an FBI agent</li><li>Josh Brolin as Matt Graver, a CIA officer</li><li>Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick</li><li>Victor Garber as Dave Jennings</li><li>Jon Bernthal as Ted</li><li>Daniel Kaluuya as Reggie Wayne</li><li>Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Forsing</li><li>Raoul Trujillo as Rafael</li><li>Julio Cesar Cedillo as Fausto Alarc\u00f3n</li><li>Hank Rogerson as Phil Coopers</li><li>Bernardo Saracino as Manuel D\u00edaz</li><li>Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Silvio</li><li>Edgar Arreola as Guillermo</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>In December 2013, it was announced that Denis Villeneuve would direct a Mexican border drama, Sicario (, the Spanish word for \"hitman\", from the Sicarii), from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan.
