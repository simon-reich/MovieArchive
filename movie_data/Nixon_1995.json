    "plot": "Writer, Producer, and Director Oliver Stone's exploration of former President Richard Nixon's strict Quaker upbringing, his nascent political strivings in law school, and his strangely self-effacing courtship of his wife, Pat (Joan Allen). The contradictions in his character are revealed early, in the vicious campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas and the oddly masochistic Checkers speech. His defeat at the hands of the hated and envied John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, followed by the loss of the 1962 California gubernatorial race, seem to signal the end of his career. Yet, although wholly lacking in charisma, Nixon remains a brilliant political operator, seizing the opportunity provided by the backlash against the antiwar movement to take the Presidency in 1968. It is only when safely in office, running far ahead in the polls for the 1972 Presidential election, that his growing paranoia comes to full flower, triggering the Watergate scandal.",

Kennedy, and followed 13 years later by W., about George W. Bush.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1972, the White House Plumbers break into The Watergate and are subsequently arrested.\r\nEighteen months later in December 1973, Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig (Powers Boothe), brings Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) audio tapes for Nixon to listen to. The two men discuss the Watergate scandal and the resulting chaos. After discussing the death of J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon uses profanity when discussing John Dean, James McCord and others involved in Watergate. As Haig turns to leave, Nixon asks Haig why he hasn't been given a pistol to commit suicide like an honorable soldier.\r\nNixon starts the taping system, which triggers memories that begin a series of flashbacks within the film. The first begins on June 23, 1972, about one week after the break-in, during a meeting with H. R. Haldeman (James Woods), John Ehrlichman (J. T. Walsh) and Dean (David Hyde Pierce). Ehrlichman and Dean leave, and Nixon speaks the \"smoking gun\" tape to Haldeman.\r\nThe film covers most aspects of Nixon's life and political career and implies that Nixon and his wife abused alcohol and prescription medications. Nixon's health problems, including his bout of phlebitis and pneumonia during the Watergate crisis, are also shown, and his various medicants are sometimes attributed to these health issues. The film also hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the John F. Kennedy assassination through references to the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president spiraled out of control to culminate in Kennedy's assassination and, eventually, Watergate.\r\nThe film ends with Nixon's resignation and departure from the lawn of the White House on the helicopter, Army One. Real life footage of Nixon's state funeral in Yorba Linda, California plays out over the extended end credits, and all living ex-presidents at the time\u2014Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and then-president Bill Clinton\u2014are shown in attendance.\r\nCast\r\nFirst family\r\nAnthony Hopkins as Richard Nixon\r\nJoan Allen as Pat Nixon\r\nAnnabeth Gish as Julie Nixon Eisenhower\r\nMarley Shelton as Tricia Nixon Cox\r\nWhite House staff and cabinet\r\nJames Woods as H.

The character may be a reference to Nixon's meetings with Clint Murchison, Sr., although he also illuminates Nixon's relationships with Howard Hughes, H. L. Hunt and other entrepreneurs.\r\nTony Lo Bianco as Johnny Roselli\r\nGeorge Plimpton as the President's lawyer\r\nProduction\r\nOrigins\r\nEric Hamburg, former speechwriter and staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, got the idea of a film about Nixon after having dinner with Oliver Stone. Originally, Oliver Stone had been developing two projects \u2014 the musical Evita and a movie about Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. When they both did not get made, Stone turned his attention to a biopic about Richard Nixon. The former President's death on April 22, 1994, was also a key factor in Stone's decision to make a Nixon film. He pitched the film to Warner Bros., but, according to the director, they saw it, \"as a bunch of unattractive older white men sitting around in suits, with a lot of dialogue and not enough action\".\r\nIn 1993, Hamburg mentioned the idea of a Nixon film to writer Stephen J. Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician's misdeeds, both known and speculative. Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment on November 1993. They conceived of a concept referred to as \"the Beast\", which Wilkinson describes as \"a headless monster that lurches through postwar history,\" a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War, and helped Nixon's rise to power and his fall from it as well. Stone said in an interview that Nixon realizes that \"the Beast\" \"is more powerful than he is. We can't get into it that much, but we hint at it so many times \u2014 the military-industrial complex, the forces of money\". In another interview, the director elaborates,\r\nI see the Beast in its essence as a System ... which grinds the individual down ... it's a System of checks and balances that drives itself off: 1) the power of money and markets; 2) State power, Government power; 3) corporate power, which is probably greater than state power; 4) the political process, or election through money, which is therefore in tow to the System; and 5) the media, which mostly protects the status quo and their ownership's interests.\r\nIt was this concept that convinced Stone to make Nixon and he told Hamburg to hire Rivele and Wilkinson. Stone commissioned the first draft of the film's screenplay in the fall of 1993. Rivele and Wilkinson delivered the first draft of their script on June 17, 1994, the anniversary of the Watergate scandal. Stone loved the script but felt that the third act and the ending needed more work. They wrote another draft and delivered it on August 9, the 20th anniversary of Nixon's resignation.\r\nPre-production\r\nStone immersed himself in research with the help of Hamburg. With Hamburg and actors Hopkins and James Woods, Stone flew to Washington, D.C. and interviewed the surviving members of Nixon's inner circle: lawyer Leonard Garment and Attorney General Elliot Richardson. He also interviewed Robert McNamara, a former Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The director also hired Alexander Butterfield, a key figure in the Watergate scandal who handled the flow of paper to the President, as a consultant to make sure that the Oval Office was realistically depicted, former deputy White House counsel John Sears, and John Dean, who made sure that every aspect of the script was accurate and wrote a few uncredited scenes for the film. Butterfield also appears in a few scenes as a White House staffer. To research their roles, Powers Boothe, David Hyde Pierce and Paul Sorvino talked to their real-life counterparts, but J.T. Walsh decided not to contact John Ehrlichman because he had threatened to sue after reading an early version of the script and was not happy with how he was portrayed. Hopkins watched a lot of documentary footage on Nixon. At night, he would go to sleep with the Nixon footage playing, letting it seep into his subconscious. Hopkins said, \"It's taking in all this information and if you're relaxed enough, it begins to take you over.\"\r\nStone originally had a three-picture deal with Regency Enterprises which included JFK, Heaven and Earth, and Natural Born Killers. After the success of Killers, Arnon Milchan, head of Regency, signed Stone for three more motion pictures. Stone could make any film up to a budget of $42.5 million. When Stone told Milchan that he wanted to make Nixon, Milchan, who was not keen on the idea, told the director that he would only give him $35 million, thinking that this would cause Stone to abandon the project. Stone took the project to Hungarian financier Andrew G. Vajna who had co-financing deal with Disney. Vajna's company, Cinergi Pictures, were willing to finance the $38 million film. This angered Milchan who claimed that Nixon was his film because of his three-picture deal with Stone and he threatened to sue. He withdrew after Stone paid him an undisclosed amount. Stone was finalizing the film's budget a week before shooting was to begin. He made a deal with Cinergi and Disney's Hollywood Pictures in order to supply the $43 million budget. To cut costs, Stone leased the White House sets from Rob Reiner's film The American President.\r\nCasting\r\nThe studio did not like Stone's choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson \u2014 two of Stone's original choices. The director also considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, \"The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness. I felt that was the quality that always marked Nixon.\" When the actor met the director he got the impression that Stone was \"one of the great bad boys of American pop culture, and I might be a fool to walk away.\" What convinced Hopkins to ultimately take on the role and \"impersonate the soul of Nixon were the scenes in the film when he talks about his mother and father. That affected me.\" Hopkins wore a hair piece and false teeth \"to hint at a physical resemblance to Nixon\".\r\nWhen Beatty was thinking about doing the film, he insisted on doing a reading of the script with an actress and Joan Allen was flown in from New York City. Afterwards, Beatty told Stone that he had found his Pat Nixon.\r\nPrincipal photography\r\nThe film began shooting on May 1, 1995 but there was a week of pre-shooting at the end of April to film scenes that would be used as part of a mock documentary about Nixon's career. Early on during principal photography, Hopkins was intimidated by the amount of dialogue he had to learn, that was being added and changed all the time as he recalled, \"There were moments when I wanted to get out, when I wanted to just do a nice Knots Landing or something.\" Sorvino told him that his accent was all wrong. Sorvino claims he told Hopkins that he thought \"there was room for improvement\" and that he would be willing to help him. Woods says that Sorvino told Hopkins that he was \"doing the whole thing wrong\" and that he was an \"expert\" who could help him. Woods recalls that Sorvino took Hopkins to lunch and then he quit that afternoon. Hopkins told Stone that he wanted to quit the production but the director managed to convince him to stay. According to the actors, this was all good-natured joking. Woods said, \"I'd always tell him how great he was in Psycho. I'd call him Lady Perkins all the time instead of Sir Anthony Hopkins.\"\r\nIn Spring of 1994, Time magazine reported that an early draft of the screenplay linked Nixon to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The facts contained in the script were based on research from various sources, including documents, transcripts and hours of footage from the Nixon White House. Dean said about the film's accuracy: \"In the larger picture, it reflected accurately what happened.\" Stone addressed the criticism of fictional material in the film, saying, \"The material we invented was not done haphazardly or whimsically, it was based on research and interpretation.\" John Taylor, head of the Nixon Presidential Library, leaked a copy of the script to Richard Helms, former Director of the CIA, who threatened to sue the production. In response, Stone cut out all scenes with Helms from the theatrical print and claimed that he did for \"artistic reasons\" only to reinstate this footage on the home video release.\r\nDuring the post-production phase, Stone had his editors in three different rooms with the scenes from the film revolving from one room to another, \"depending on how successful they were\". If one editor wasn't successful with a scene then it went to another. Stone said that it was \"the most intense post- I've ever done, even more intense than JFK\" because they were screening the film three times a week, making changes in 48\u201372 hours, rescreening the film and then making another 48 hours of changes.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nIn its opening weekend, Nixon grossed a total of $2.2 million in 514 theaters. As of December 19, 2006, the film had grossed a total of $13.6 million in the United States and Canada, below its $44 million budget.\r\nCritical reaction\r\nTwo days before the film was released in theaters, the Richard Nixon Library and birthplace in Yorba Linda, California issued a statement on behalf of the Nixon family, calling parts of the film \"reprehensible\" and that it was designed to \"defame and degrade President and Mrs. Nixon's memories in the mind of the American public\". This statement was based on a published copy of the script. The statement also criticized Stone's depiction of Nixon's private life, that of his childhood, and his part in planning the assassination of Fidel Castro. Stone responded that his \"purpose in making the film, Nixon was neither malicious nor defamatory\", and was an attempt to gain \"a fuller understanding of the life and career of Richard Nixon \u2014 the good and the bad, the triumphs and the tragedies, and the legacy he left his nation and the world\". Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller, wrote a letter to Nixon's daughters saying that Stone had \"committed a grave disservice to your family, to the Presidency, and to American history\". Stone does not see his film as the definitive statement on Nixon but as \"a basis to start reading, to start investigating on your own\".\r\nSome critics took Stone to task for portraying Nixon as an alcoholic, though Stone says that was based on information from books by Stephen Ambrose, Fawn Brodie, and Tom Wicker. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for how it took \"on the resonance of classic tragedy. Tragedy requires the fall of a hero, and one of the achievements of Nixon is to show that greatness was within his reach.\" Ebert also placed the film on his list of the top ten films of the year. Janet Maslin from The New York Times praised Anthony Hopkins' performance and \"his character's embattled outlook and stiff, hunched body language with amazing skill\".\r\nMick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, felt that \"the problem here isn't accuracy. It's absurdity. Hopkins' exaggerated portrayal of Nixon is the linchpin of a film that in its conception and presentation consistently veers into camp\". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, also had a problem with Hopkins' portrayal: \"Hopkins, though, is a failure. He finds neither the timbre of Nixon's plummy baritone, with its wonderfully false attempts at intimacy, nor the stature of a career climber who, with raw hands, scaled the mountain and was still not high or big enough.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \"It's gripping psychodrama \u2014 just don't confuse Nixon with history.\"\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 74% approval rating, based reviews from 61 critics, with an average score of 6.8/10. The site's consensus states: \"Much like its subject's time in office, Nixon might have ended sooner -- but what remains is an engrossing, well-acted look at the rise and fall of a fascinating political figure.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 66 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nAccolades\r\nIt was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Joan Allen), Best Music, Original Dramatic Score and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.\r\nEntertainment Weekly ranked Nixon #40 on their \"50 Best Biopics Ever\" list and one of the 25 \"Powerful Political Thrillers\".\r\nHome media\r\nThe theatrical cut of the film was released on DVD on June 15, 1999. A director's cut was released on DVD as part of an Oliver Stone boxset in 2001, running 212 mins and including 28 minutes of previously deleted scenes restored. Much of the added time consists of two scenes: one in which Nixon meets with Central Intelligence Agency director Richard Helms (played by Sam Waterston) and another on Tricia Nixon's wedding day, where J. Edgar Hoover persuades Nixon to install the taping system in the Oval Office. The Director's Cut was released individually on DVD in 2002. The Director's Cut was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (branded as Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment) on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 19, 2008 with the first anamorphic widescreen version of the film in North America.",
            "html": "<h2>Nixon (film)</h2><p>Nixon is a 1995 American epic historical drama film directed by Oliver Stone, produced by Clayton Townsend, Stone and Andrew G. Vajna. The film was written by Stone, Christopher Wilkinson and Stephen J. Rievele, with significant contributions from \"project consultants\" Christopher Scheer and Robert Scheer. The film tells the story of the political and personal life of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, played by Anthony Hopkins.</p><p>The film portrays Nixon as a complex and, in many respects, admirable, though deeply flawed, person. Nixon begins with a disclaimer that the film is \"an attempt to understand the truth based on numerous public sources and on an incomplete historical record.\"</p><p>The cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, Annabeth Gish, Marley Shelton, Powers Boothe, J. T. Walsh, E. G. Marshall, James Woods, Paul Sorvino, Bob Hoskins, Larry Hagman, Ed Harris and David Hyde Pierce, plus archival appearances from political figures such as President Bill Clinton in TV footage from the Nixon funeral service.</p><p>The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Supporting Actress (Joan Allen), Best Original Score (John Williams) and Best Original Screenplay.</p><p>This was Stone's second of three films about the American presidency, made four years after JFK, about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and followed 13 years later by W., about George W. Bush.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 1972, the White House Plumbers break into The Watergate and are subsequently arrested.</p><p>Eighteen months later in December 1973, Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig (Powers Boothe), brings Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) audio tapes for Nixon to listen to. The two men discuss the Watergate scandal and the resulting chaos. After discussing the death of J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon uses profanity when discussing John Dean, James McCord and others involved in Watergate. As Haig turns to leave, Nixon asks Haig why he hasn't been given a pistol to commit suicide like an honorable soldier.</p><p>Nixon starts the taping system, which triggers memories that begin a series of flashbacks within the film. The first begins on June 23, 1972, about one week after the break-in, during a meeting with H. R. Haldeman (James Woods), John Ehrlichman (J. T. Walsh) and Dean (David Hyde Pierce). Ehrlichman and Dean leave, and Nixon speaks the \"smoking gun\" tape to Haldeman.</p><p>The film covers most aspects of Nixon's life and political career and implies that Nixon and his wife abused alcohol and prescription medications. Nixon's health problems, including his bout of phlebitis and pneumonia during the Watergate crisis, are also shown, and his various medicants are sometimes attributed to these health issues. The film also hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the John F. Kennedy assassination through references to the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president spiraled out of control to culminate in Kennedy's assassination and, eventually, Watergate.</p><p>The film ends with Nixon's resignation and departure from the lawn of the White House on the helicopter, Army One. Real life footage of Nixon's state funeral in Yorba Linda, California plays out over the extended end credits, and all living ex-presidents at the time\u2014Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.

Originally, Oliver Stone had been developing two projects \u2014 the musical Evita and a movie about Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. When they both did not get made, Stone turned his attention to a biopic about Richard Nixon. The former President's death on April 22, 1994, was also a key factor in Stone's decision to make a Nixon film.
