The film also stars Clement and Waititi, along with Jonathan Brugh, Ben Fransham, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, Stu Rutherford, and Jackie van Beek. The film's plot concerns several vampires who live together in a flat in Wellington.\r\nWhat We Do in the Shadows premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014. It was released theatrically on 18 August 2014 by Madman Entertainment, and received critical acclaim. The film earned $6.9 million on a $1.6 million budget.\r\nPlot\r\nA documentary crew follows four vampire roommates\u2014Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr\u2014 who share a flat in the Wellington suburb of Te Aro. All of the vampires possess supernatural powers, including levitation and the ability to transform into animals. Viago is a 379-year-old dandy from the 18th century, who originally traveled to New Zealand in the 1910s in search of the love of his life Katherine; Vladislav is an 862-year-old known as \"Vladislav the Poker\", who is haunted by memories of his nemesis \"the Beast\"; and Deacon is a 183-year-old former Nazi and the \"young rebel\" of the group who was bitten by Petyr\u2014a reclusive, 8,000-year-old vampire who behaves like a feral animal.\r\nEach night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon take the bus into town and prowl the streets of Wellington for people to kill. Deacon's human familiar, Jackie, runs errands for the vampires and cleans up the gore left behind by their feeding. A married mother, Jackie hopes to attain immortality\u2014but is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as promised. Deacon requests that Jackie bring virgins to the flat so that the vampires can feed on them. She lures a woman who insulted her in primary school and Nick, her ex-boyfriend from childhood, to the flat. Though neither are actually virgins, the woman is killed, and Nick is attacked by Petyr. Nick survives the attack and becomes a vampire.\r\nTwo months later, the vampires accept Nick into their group and bond with his human friend Stu\u2014a computer analyst who introduces them to modern technology such as the Internet and cameras. Viago uses the Internet to find Katherine, who is now a 96-year-old widow living in a rest home in Wellington, and also briefly reconnects with his old servant Philip. Despite being able to get his new friends into popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire. Nick is also held in contempt by Deacon, who resents Nick's newfound popularity and his careless revealing of his vampirism to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a vampire hunter, breaks into the flat basement during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight.\r\nThe vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and Deacon tries to kill Nick before being interrupted by a police welfare check. The police, whom Viago hypnotises, warn the vampires about numerous fire hazards inside the flat. Once the police leave, Nick is banished from the flat by the remaining vampires, though Stu is permitted to come as he pleases.\r\nSeveral months later, the vampires receive an invitation to the annual Unholy Masquerade, hosted for the local undead population of vampires, zombies, and witches. Vladislav refuses to attend after learning that \"the Beast\" will be the guest of honor. When Viago and Deacon arrive at the ball, they find in attendance Nick, Stu and Jackie, the latter of whom has been turned into a vampire by Nick. \"The Beast\" is revealed to be Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, and when Stu and the camera crew are discovered to be living humans, the party guests threaten to kill and feed on them. Vladislav arrives and fights with Pauline's new boyfriend Julian. Stu impales Julian, and the vampires and camera crew escape the ball with him, only to encounter a rival pack of werewolves who transform under the full moon. One cameraman is disemboweled by a werewolf, and Stu is viciously mauled. Believing Stu to be dead, the vampires run away and grieve for him.\r\nAfter a few days, Nick returns to the flat with Stu and the werewolves. Stu reveals that he survived the attack and transformed to a werewolf that night. With Stu's urging, the pack is allowed to visit the flat and reconciles with the vampires\u2014and Nick's banishment is rescinded. Viago also reconnects with Katherine, whom he turns into a vampire and rekindles his romance with. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline and Jackie has made her husband her familiar.

He did not realise his role was so important until the film's premiere.\r\nAccording to Waititi and Clement their favourite vampire films were The Lost Boys, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Interview with the Vampire.

The film was warmly received by UK newspapers, with The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw describing it as \"the best comedy of the year\", while The Telegraph's Tim Robey found it \"desperately funny\". Film International, in a positive review, commended the film for noting, with a double of Count Orlok locked in the vampires' basement, that the true vampire film tradition is repressed by the current craze. Variety was more critical, writing that \"Some genre fans who prefer the silly to the satiric may bite, but the anemic pic isn't remotely weird or witty enough for cult immortality.\"\r\nHowever Mark Kermode gave the film a negative review. until a couple years later on the BFI Player, Kermode chose this film on his BFI Player choice's film and gave a positive review.\r\nBox office\r\nWhat We Do in the Shadows grossed US$2 million in New Zealand and $3.4 million in the US.\r\nHome media\r\nWhat We Do in the Shadows was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 26 November 2014 by Weltkino Filmverleih.\r\nProposed sequel\r\nA sequel to the film, focused on the werewolves depicted in What We Do in the Shadows, was in development, but stopped due to some unresolved production issues. Originally rumoured to be titled What We Do in the Moonlight, the working title was later announced as We're Wolves.\r\nIn May 2019, Waititi said \u201c'We're Wolves' is the film that Jemaine and I keep pretending that we\u2019re making. Every couple of years we say, we\u2019re making this new film called 'We're Wolves' which follows the werewolves from the film,\u201d said Waititi. \u201cI feel bad to even mention it now because we keep saying it, it\u2019s like a dad saying, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll be home for Christmas.\u2019 I suppose we\u2019re just two dads out on the road enjoying our lives and going, \u2018We\u2019re not coming home for Christmas.\u2019 We'll send a postcard. It's not like we don't want to come home for Christmas. We would like nothing more but we have a lot of shit going on. When are you going to die? Do you have a ... deadline before your death? I guarantee it before then. Five years, 10 years? It took us seven years to write the film, so you do the math. That was a sad thing to say.\"\r\nShort films\r\nIn 2005, Waititi and Clement wrote and directed a short film titled What We Do in the Shadows: Interviews with Some Vampires, which was a precursor to the feature-length film. The short stars Jonny Brugh, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stu Rutherford in their roles of Deacon, Nick and Stu respectively.\r\nIn June 2014, Waititi, in conjunction with Discover New Zealand, produced a promotional short film titled Vampire's Guide to Vellington, in which he reprises his role as Viago von Blitzenberg.\r\nTelevision spin-offs\r\nWellington Paranormal\r\nIn September 2016, it was revealed that Waititi and Clement were planning a procedural comedy series based on the police officers, O'Leary and Minogue, who had minor roles in the film, titled Wellington Paranormal. The series producers granted Waititi and Clement $1 million to produce six 30-minute episodes for the series, which aired on TVNZ 2 from 11 July 2018. The character Nick from the film also appeared in the episode \"A Normal Night\". New Zealand On Air announced that a second series with thirteen episodes would air in 2019.\r\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\r\nAn American version of the film was developed as a television series. A pilot was ordered by FX, which featured Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, and Harvey Guill\u00e9n. Executive producers of the show include Clement, Waititi, Scott Rudin, Paul Simms, Garrett Basch, and Eli Bush.
