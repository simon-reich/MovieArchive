The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. They will live alone there with oppressive, strange and almost religious rules, until she needs to hire a group of servants for them. Their arrival will accidentally begin to break the rules with unexpected consequences.",

She lives with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a rare disease characterized by photosensitivity. Grace hires three new servants\u2014the aging Mrs. Bertha Mills, elderly gardener Edmund Tuttle, and a mute girl named Lydia. Mrs. Mills explains to Grace that she worked in the same house many years before. When odd events occur at the house, Grace begins to fear there are unknown \"others\" present. Anne claims to have seen a group of people in the house several times: a man, a woman, an old woman and a child called Victor, who claimed that \"the house is theirs\". After Grace hears footsteps and unknown voices, she orders the house to be searched. Grace finds a 19th-century \"book of the dead\"\u2014a photo album of mourning portrait photos. When Grace asks Mrs. Mills about her previous experience in the house, Mrs. Mills recounts that many left due to an outbreak of tuberculosis.\r\nAt night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house. Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to check a small nearby cemetery to see if there was a family buried there who had a little boy named Victor. Tuttle finds the cemetery but, per Mrs. Mills's orders, covers the gravestones with leaves. Mrs. Mills assures Tuttle that Grace will learn in due time the reasons behind the unexplained events. Outside, Grace runs into her husband Charles, whom she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during his short stay at the house. Later, Grace comes across an old woman in one of the rooms and attacks her. The old woman is only a vision and Grace has in fact attacked her own daughter, Anne. Later, Anne tells her brother that their mother went mad in the same way \"that day\" but he does not remember. Charles says he must leave for the front, even though Grace claims that the war is over. The two embrace and lie motionless together in bed.\r\nThe next morning, Charles has left and the children are screaming that the curtains are gone, letting in sunlight. Grace accuses the servants of removing the curtains and banishes them from the house. That night, the children sneak outside and discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the servants. The children retreat in fear when they see the servants approach. Meanwhile, Grace finds a photograph that has fallen out of the book of the dead onto the floor under some furniture. It is a photograph of the corpses of the three servants. The children run upstairs and hide in the bedroom where they are discovered by the elderly woman. Mrs. Mills returns to the house and tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders. Grace discovers that the old woman is in fact a medium in a s\u00e9ance with Victor's parents, who has found out via automatic writing that Grace smothered the children to death with a pillow in a fit of rage before committing suicide. Grace realizes that the \"others\" are the family that has moved into the house, and that she, her children and the servants are dead. Following this display of supernatural activity, Victor and his family vacate the house and leave it in the occupancy of the ghosts.\r\nCast\r\nNicole Kidman as Grace\r\nFionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Mills\r\nChristopher Eccleston as Charlie\r\nAlakina Mann as Anne\r\nJames Bentley as Nicholas\r\nEric Sykes as Mr. Tuttle\r\nElaine Cassidy as Lydia\r\nKeith Allen as Mr. Marlish\r\nRen\u00e9e Asherson as the Old Lady\r\nMichelle Fairley as Mrs. Marlish\r\nProduction\r\nThe production crew visited Penshurst Place in Kent to film at the Lime Walk in the gardens. The Lime Walk was used in the scene where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) went looking for a priest in the thick fog and instead met her husband who had returned from the war. Filming locations are, among other spots, Palacio de los Hornillos in Las Fraguas, Northern Spain, and in Madrid.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe Others was released August 10, 2001 in 1,678 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed $14 million its opening weekend, ranking fourth at the box office. It stayed in fourth for three more weeks, expanding to more theaters. During the weekend of September 21\u201323, it was second at the box office, grossing $5 million in 2,801 theaters. The film, which cost $17 million to produce, eventually grossed $96.5 million in the United States and Canada and $113.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total gross of $209.9 million.\r\nCritical reception\r\nMany critics praised the performances of the stars especially Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 83% approval rating based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads, \"The Others is a spooky thriller that reminds us that a movie doesn't need expensive special effects to be creepy.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 29 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, praising that \"...Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric.\" However, he noted that \"in drawing out his effects, Amen\u00e1bar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance.\"\r\nAlthough the film deals primarily with the spiritual interaction of ghosts with each other rather than with living humans, William Skidelsky of The Observer has suggested that it was inspired by the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw written by Henry James.\r\nAccolades\r\nGoya Awards: Best Cinematography (Javier Aguirresarobe) Best Director (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar) Best Editing (Nacho Ruiz Capillas) Best Film Best Production Design Best Production Supervision Best Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar) Best Sound\r\nBest Cinematography (Javier Aguirresarobe)\r\nBest Director (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar)\r\nBest Editing (Nacho Ruiz Capillas)\r\nBest Film\r\nBest Production Design\r\nBest Production Supervision\r\nBest Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar)\r\nBest Sound\r\nKansas City Film Critics Circle Awards: Best Actress (Nicole Kidman)\r\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\r\nLondon Film Critics: Best Actress of the Year (Nicole Kidman)\r\nBest Actress of the Year (Nicole Kidman)\r\nOnline Film Critics: Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) Best Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar)\r\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\r\nBest Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar)\r\nSaturn Awards: Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) Best Supporting Actress (Fionnula Flanagan) Best Horror Film\r\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\r\nBest Supporting Actress (Fionnula Flanagan)\r\nBest Horror Film\r\nIn popular culture\r\nScary Movie 3 includes parodies of scenes from the film, particularly the famous \"I am your daughter\" sequence.\r\nHum Kaun Hai and Anjaane: The Unknown are Hindi remakes of The Others\r\nSpanish Movie is a parody film that spoofs several successful Spanish horror/drama films, primarily The Others but also The Orphanage, Pan's Labyrinth, REC, and others.\r\nAustralian Band Elora Danan wrote a song about the film called \"Thank God for Their Growth in Faith and Love\" (a line seen on the children's blackboard in a later scene) which was a track on their debut EP We All Have Secrets.\r\nElectronic music artist Venetian Snares uses a sample from the film in the song \"Children's Limbo\" on the album Find Candace.\r\nSimpsons' Treehouse of Horror XXV includes a segment spoofing the film in which the Simpsons are haunted by their former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show.",
