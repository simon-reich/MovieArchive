As Stanley spars to maintain academic dominance over his would-be prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Fred, Rose attempts to dampen her own ambitions and adjust to married life while living under the roof of their fiery intellectual hosts with quicksilver loyalties and myriad neuroses. When the motives of Shirley's literary muse prove elusive, Rose's curiosity and trusting nature make her tender prey for a brilliant author whose only allegiance is to her work.",

No sooner do they arrive than Stanley asks the pregnant Rosie to take over the household chores, as Shirley has become incapacitated by mental illness and writer's block. Shirley is obsessed by story of a young woman who recently disappeared from Bennington's campus and wants to tell her story as a novel. Unbeknownst to the Nemsers, Shirley and Stanley have a perverse arrangement to psychologically break down the Nemsers by causing strains in their marriage, sabotaging Fred's attempts at academic tenure, and to try to instigate affairs with them (which Shirley briefly does with Rosie). As the Nemsers slowly crack under the pressure of Stanley's manipulation and Shirley's abuse, Shirley gains increasing clarity and resolve to finish her novel. By the time that Rosie is on the verge of suicide and Stanley has ensured that Fred is never going to get hired at Bennington, Shirley completes her novel and Stanley declares it a masterpiece.
