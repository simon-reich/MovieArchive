It also earned four nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, winning for Best Costume Design, and received two Golden Globe nominations.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1950s London, fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock creates dresses for members of high society. His charisma is matched by his obsessive and controlling personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. The superstitious Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and often stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes.\r\nAfter designing a new gown for a revered client, Countess Henrietta Harding, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a foreign waitress, Alma Elson. He asks her to have dinner with him, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his model, muse, and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.\r\nAt first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds\u2019 work, but he proves aloof, hard to please, and overly finicky. They begin to bicker. When Alma tries to show her love for Reynolds by preparing a romantic dinner for two, he lashes out, saying he will not tolerate deviations from the routines he has worked hard to perfect. Alma \u201cretaliates\u201d by poisoning Reynolds\u2019 tea with wild mushrooms gathered outside his country house. As he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, Reynolds collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and has hallucinations of his mother. Alma nurses him back to health. He asks her to marry him; she accepts.\r\nAfter a brief honeymoon, Reynolds and Alma soon start bickering again. Cyril reveals to Reynolds that the Countess is now a client at a rival fashion house, and hints that his classical designs have begun appearing out-of-date. As Reynolds feels his work is suffering, he concludes it may be time to break up with Alma, who overhears the conversation.\r\nAt the country house, Alma responds by making Reynolds a poisoned omelet. As he chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable with only her to take care of him. Reynolds swallows the omelet and tells her to kiss him. As Reynolds lies ill, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and her running the dressmaking business as a partner. She acknowledges that while there may be challenges ahead, their love and their new arrangement can overcome them.\r\nCast\r\nDaniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock\r\nLesley Manville as Cyril Woodcock\r\nVicky Krieps as Alma Elson\r\nCamilla Rutherford as Johanna\r\nGina McKee as Countess Henrietta Harding\r\nGeorge Glasgow as Nigel Cheddar-Goode\r\nBrian Gleeson as Dr. Robert Hardy\r\nHarriet Sansom Harris as Barbara Rose\r\nLujza Richter as Princess Mona Braganza\r\nJulia Davis as Lady Baltimore\r\nNicholas Mander as Lord Baltimore\r\nPhilip Franks as Peter Martin\r\nPhyllis MacMahon as Tippy\r\nSilas Carson as Rubio Gurrerro\r\nRichard Graham as George Riley\r\nPeter Cobden as the fisherman\r\nIan Harrod as the Registrar\r\nJane Perry as Mrs. Vaughan\r\nProduction\r\nAnderson became interested in the fashion industry after reading about designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga. Reynolds Woodcock's obsessive fastidiousness is loosely inspired by English-American fashion designer Charles James.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in late January 2017 in Lythe, England, United Kingdom, with a number of other locations in the North York Moors National Park also featuring, including Robin Hood's Bay and Staithes. Filming also took place in 2017 at Owlpen Manor in the Cotswolds and in the London neighborhood of Fitzrovia, in Fitzroy Square, and Grafton Mews. Woodcock drives a maroon Bristol 405 in the film. Filming also took place at the Grandhotel Giessbach, Brienz, Switzerland, Lake Brienz and Brienzer Rothorn.

            "html": "<h2>Phantom Thread</h2><p>Phantom Thread is a 2017 American period romantic drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, set in the haute couture world of London in the 1950s. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis as a dressmaker who takes a young waitress, played by Vicky Krieps, as his muse; it is Day-Lewis's final role before his retirement. The film is the first Anderson film shot outside the United States, with principal photography beginning in January 2017 in Lythe, England. It is Anderson's second collaboration with Day-Lewis, following There Will Be Blood (2007), and his fifth with composer Jonny Greenwood.</p><p>Phantom Thread premiered in New York City on December 11, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2017. The film received acclaim for its acting, screenplay, direction, musical score, costume design, and production values. It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017.</p><p>At the 90th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Day-Lewis, Supporting Actress for Lesley Manville and Best Original Score, and won for Best Costume Design. It also earned four nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, winning for Best Costume Design, and received two Golden Globe nominations.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 1950s London, fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock creates dresses for members of high society. His charisma is matched by his obsessive and controlling personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. The superstitious Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and often stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes.</p><p>After designing a new gown for a revered client, Countess Henrietta Harding, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a foreign waitress, Alma Elson. He asks her to have dinner with him, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his model, muse, and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.</p><p>At first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds\u2019 work, but he proves aloof, hard to please, and overly finicky. They begin to bicker. When Alma tries to show her love for Reynolds by preparing a romantic dinner for two, he lashes out, saying he will not tolerate deviations from the routines he has worked hard to perfect. Alma \u201cretaliates\u201d by poisoning Reynolds\u2019 tea with wild mushrooms gathered outside his country house. As he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, Reynolds collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and has hallucinations of his mother. Alma nurses him back to health. He asks her to marry him; she accepts.</p><p>After a brief honeymoon, Reynolds and Alma soon start bickering again. Cyril reveals to Reynolds that the Countess is now a client at a rival fashion house, and hints that his classical designs have begun appearing out-of-date. As Reynolds feels his work is suffering, he concludes it may be time to break up with Alma, who overhears the conversation.</p><p>At the country house, Alma responds by making Reynolds a poisoned omelet. As he chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable with only her to take care of him. Reynolds swallows the omelet and tells her to kiss him. As Reynolds lies ill, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and her running the dressmaking business as a partner. She acknowledges that while there may be challenges ahead, their love and their new arrangement can overcome them.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Daniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock</li><li>Lesley Manville as Cyril Woodcock</li><li>Vicky Krieps as Alma Elson</li><li>Camilla Rutherford as Johanna</li><li>Gina McKee as Countess Henrietta Harding</li><li>George Glasgow as Nigel Cheddar-Goode</li><li>Brian Gleeson as Dr. Robert Hardy</li><li>Harriet Sansom Harris as Barbara Rose</li><li>Lujza Richter as Princess Mona Braganza</li><li>Julia Davis as Lady Baltimore</li><li>Nicholas Mander as Lord Baltimore</li><li>Philip Franks as Peter Martin</li><li>Phyllis MacMahon as Tippy</li><li>Silas Carson as Rubio Gurrerro</li><li>Richard Graham as George Riley</li><li>Peter Cobden as the fisherman</li><li>Ian Harrod as the Registrar</li><li>Jane Perry as Mrs. Vaughan</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>Anderson became interested in the fashion industry after reading about designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga.
