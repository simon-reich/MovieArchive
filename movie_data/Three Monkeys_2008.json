    "plot": "Near the Bosporus, Ey\u00fcp and Hacer live in a modest flat with their son Ismail, in his twenties, who's doing poorly in his studies. Few words pass between them, and a past family tragedy brings sorrow daily. On a rainy night, Ey\u00fcp's boss Servet, a wealthy businessman who's entering politics, hits a pedestrian on a lonely road. He drives off and offers money to Ey\u00fcp if Ey\u00fcp will take the fall - probably a six-month sentence. Ey\u00fcp agrees, and while he's in prison, Ismail wants his mother to ask Servet for enough money to buy a car. Servet, in turn, desires Hacer. How can this play out?",

The film opens as a wealthy businessman, Servet, running a campaign for the upcoming election, is driving in his car alone and sleepy, struggling to keep his eyes open. Seconds later he hits and kills a pedestrian in the middle of the road. Servet panics when another car with a couple inside approaches. He sneaks away.\r\nEy\u00fcp, a man living in a slum at the Yedikule neighborhood in \u0130stanbul, with his wife and only son, is the driver of Servet. He wakes up in the middle of the night with his cell phone ringing. It's his boss, telling Ey\u00fcp to meet him immediately. Shivering in shock, Servet explains the current events to his driver. His excuse is if the fatal accident comes out in press it would terminate his political career, so he proposes Ey\u00fcp to take over the penalty and stay in prison for a brief period of time in exchange for a lump sum payment upon his release, whilst still paying his salary to his family so they can get by. Ey\u00fcp accepts the deal.\r\nAn unspecified time passes, summer arrives, and Ey\u00fcp's son \u0130smail fails to enter college again. His mother, Hacer, who works in the catering division of a factory, starts worrying about her son after unpleasant events, and tries to convince him to get a job. \u0130smail suggests driving children between home and school but of course they don't have any financial source for this kind of an enterprise. \u0130smail asks his mother to request an advance payment from Servet without consulting Ey\u00fcp. Hacer meets with Servet, in his office after the election (which he lost), and requests the money. After Hacer leaves the office and starts waiting for a bus at the stop Servet persuades Hacer to accept a lift from him back to her home.\r\nMore unspecified time passes, and \u0130smail intends to visit his father. Things take a poor turn when he finds his mother having an affair with Servet. \u0130smail stands passive. After serving nine months in prison, Ey\u00fcp is released. He senses things are \"a little peculiar\" inside his home. Hacer is in love with Servet and insists on maintaining their affair. Servet disagrees. That night, Hacer and Ey\u00fcp are invited to the police station and informed that Servet has been murdered. Police officers interrogate the two and Ey\u00fcp finds out that Hacer was cheating on him. He denies knowing anything about it. \u0130smail confesses to his mother that he murdered Servet. Ey\u00fcp calms down when he pays a visit to a mosque. Afterwards, Ey\u00fcp goes on to speak with a very poor man who works and sleeps inside a tea house in the neighborhood. Ey\u00fcp makes the same proposition to the poor man, Bayram, that Servet made to him: to claim the crime committed by his son.\r\nCast\r\nYavuz Bing\u00f6l as Ey\u00fcp\r\nHatice Aslan as Hacer\r\nAhmet R\u0131fat \u015eungar as \u0130smail\r\nErcan Kesal as Servet\r\nCafer K\u00f6se as Bayram\r\nG\u00fcrkan Ayd\u0131n as the child\r\nReception\r\nThree Monkeys has received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \"certified fresh\" rating of 78%, based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Exploring the effects of a family's dealings with an underhanded politician, this crime drama avoids showing the violent outcomes of its characters' misdeeds, resulting in a lingeringly potent film.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nAccolades\r\nThe film premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, where Ceylan won, ten days later, the Award for Best Director. It also won the Golden Anchor Competition Award at the Haifa International Film Festival. The film won best special effects award at the Golden Orange Film Festival, as well as the Siyad award at the International Eurasia Film Festival.

That night, Hacer and Ey\u00fcp are invited to the police station and informed that Servet has been murdered. Police officers interrogate the two and Ey\u00fcp finds out that Hacer was cheating on him. He denies knowing anything about it. \u0130smail confesses to his mother that he murdered Servet. Ey\u00fcp calms down when he pays a visit to a mosque. Afterwards, Ey\u00fcp goes on to speak with a very poor man who works and sleeps inside a tea house in the neighborhood. Ey\u00fcp makes the same proposition to the poor man, Bayram, that Servet made to him: to claim the crime committed by his son.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Yavuz Bing\u00f6l as Ey\u00fcp</li><li>Hatice Aslan as Hacer</li><li>Ahmet R\u0131fat \u015eungar as \u0130smail</li><li>Ercan Kesal as Servet</li><li>Cafer K\u00f6se as Bayram</li><li>G\u00fcrkan Ayd\u0131n as the child</li></ul><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>Three Monkeys has received positive reviews from critics.
