Change is blowing in the wind...but seemingly far removed from the unrest in the cities is the small town of Mill Valley where for generations, the shadow of the Bellows family has loomed large. It is in their mansion on the edge of town that Sarah, a young girl with horrible secrets, turned her tortured life into a series of scary stories, written in a book that has transcended time-stories that have a way of becoming all too real for a group of teenagers who discover Sarah's terrifying tomb.",

The film went on to gross a worldwide total of $105 million against a production budget of around $28 million.\r\nPlot\r\nOn Halloween, 1968, in the small town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, three teen friends, Stella, Auggie, and Chuck, prank the bully Tommy Milner. When Tommy and his gang chase them in retaliation, the trio flees to a drive-in movie theater, where a young drifter named Ram\u00f3n hides them in his car. They invite Ram\u00f3n to explore a local \"haunted house\" that once belonged to the wealthy Bellows family, who helped found Mill Valley. Inside, they find a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows, who allegedly committed suicide in the house. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. They escape, and Stella takes Sarah's book.\r\nStella discovers a new story, entitled \"Harold\", being written in Sarah's book. Meanwhile, in reality, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold, his family's scarecrow, after it comes to life. The creature stabs him with a pitchfork, causing Tommy to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. Tommy is later reported missing; Stella and Ram\u00f3n find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes. Though Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, the others are skeptical.\r\nThat night, a new story, \"The Big Toe\", appears with Auggie as the main character. The pair attempt to warn him about the monster: a zombie searching for its missing toe, which is inside a stew that Auggie unwittingly eats. Auggie disappears after the zombie drags him under his bed. Realizing they are next, the remaining friends attempt to destroy the book; when this proves impossible, they research Sarah's life in hopes of finding a solution. A new story, \"The Red Spot\", is written. When Ruth discovers a swollen spider bite on her cheek, it explodes and releases hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized and placed in a mental institution.\r\nThe group's investigation takes them to a local hospital, where they discover that Sarah's brother performed electroshock therapy on her as part of a cover-up operation. The family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with mercury, and Sarah was tortured by her family for trying to reveal the truth, and blamed for the deed. At the hospital, Chuck is attacked by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his recurring nightmares, who absorbs him. Stella and Ram\u00f3n are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ram\u00f3n is a Vietnam War draft dodger. Ram\u00f3n reveals to Stella that it was out of fear after his brother enlisted and his dead body was returned to them in pieces. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ram\u00f3n realizes that the next creature will be the Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man kills Turner before attempting to kill Ram\u00f3n. Ram\u00f3n and Stella escape, and he lures the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to put an end to Sarah's actions.\r\nStella is taken back in time, living out part of Sarah's experience of the torture her family put her through. She promises Sarah's ghost that she will tell the real story of Sarah's life and the truth of her innocence if she stops harming people with her stories. Sarah forces her to write down the true story in blood before she and the Jangly Man vanish. Stella writes the truth about Sarah's life in the papers to the town keeping her promise. Ram\u00f3n accepts his enlistment and shares an emotional goodbye with Stella before he leaves for the war. Stella drives away with her father and a recovered Ruth, and states that she believes that they will find a way to rescue Chuck and Auggie as the film ends.\r\nCast\r\nThe Kids\r\nZoe Colletti as Stella Nicholls\r\nMichael Garza as Ram\u00f3n Morales\r\nGabriel Rush as August \"Auggie\" Hilderbrandt\r\nAustin Zajur as Charlie \"Chuck\" Steinberg\r\nNatalie Ganzhorn as Ruth \"Ruthie\" Steinberg\r\nAustin Abrams as Tommy Milner\r\nMill Valley Townspeople\r\nDean Norris as Roy Nicholls\r\nGil Bellows as Police Chief Turner\r\nLorraine Toussaint as Louise \"Lou Lou\" Baptiste Ajanae Stephenson as Young Louise Baptiste\r\nAjanae Stephenson as Young Louise Baptiste\r\nMarie Ward as Mrs. Hilderbrandt\r\nDeborah Pollitt as Mrs. Steinberg\r\nMatt Smith as Mr. Steinberg\r\nKaren Glave as Claire Baptiste\r\nKyle Labine as Deputy Hobbs\r\nVictoria Fodor as Mrs. Milner\r\nThe Monsters\r\nJavier Botet as Big Toe Corpse\r\nTroy James as Jangly Man Andrew Jackson as the voice of the Jangly Man\r\nAndrew Jackson as the voice of the Jangly Man\r\nMark Steger as Harold the Scarecrow and the Pale Lady\r\nThe Bellows Family\r\nKathleen Pollard as Sarah Bellows\r\nWill Carr as Dr. Ephraim Bellows Elias Edraki as the voice of Dr. Ephraim Bellows\r\nElias Edraki as the voice of Dr. Ephraim Bellows\r\nJane Moffat as Delanie Bellows\r\nAmanda Smith as Gertrude Bellows\r\nBrandon Knox as Harold Bellows\r\nHume Baugh as Deodat Bellows\r\nProduction\r\nIn 2013, CBS Films acquired the rights to the Alvin Schwartz's children's book series Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark from 1212 Entertainment, with the intent of producing it as a potential feature film.

            "html": "<h2>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (film)</h2><p>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a 2019 horror film directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal, based on the children's book series of the same name by Alvin Schwartz. The screenplay was adapted by Dan and Kevin Hageman, from a screen story by producer Guillermo del Toro, as well as Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. The film, an international co-production of the United States and Canada, stars Zoe Colletti, Michael Garza, Gabriel Rush, Austin Zajur, Natalie Ganzhorn, Austin Abrams, Dean Norris, Gil Bellows, and Lorraine Toussaint.</p><p>In 2013, CBS Films acquired the rights to the book series from 1212 Entertainment with the intent of producing it as a feature film. By January 2016 it was announced that del Toro would develop and potentially direct the project for CBS Films. \u00d8vredal was later to set to direct the film, with del Toro, Daniel, Brown, and Grave being among the producers. Principal photography commenced on August 27, 2018, and ended on November 1, 2018, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada.</p><p>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was theatrically released on August 9, 2019, by Lionsgate. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and praise for its depictions of the horror features from its source material. The film went on to gross a worldwide total of $105 million against a production budget of around $28 million.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>On Halloween, 1968, in the small town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, three teen friends, Stella, Auggie, and Chuck, prank the bully Tommy Milner. When Tommy and his gang chase them in retaliation, the trio flees to a drive-in movie theater, where a young drifter named Ram\u00f3n hides them in his car. They invite Ram\u00f3n to explore a local \"haunted house\" that once belonged to the wealthy Bellows family, who helped found Mill Valley. Inside, they find a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows, who allegedly committed suicide in the house. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. They escape, and Stella takes Sarah's book.</p><p>Stella discovers a new story, entitled \"Harold\", being written in Sarah's book. Meanwhile, in reality, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold, his family's scarecrow, after it comes to life. The creature stabs him with a pitchfork, causing Tommy to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. Tommy is later reported missing; Stella and Ram\u00f3n find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes. Though Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, the others are skeptical.</p><p>That night, a new story, \"The Big Toe\", appears with Auggie as the main character. The pair attempt to warn him about the monster: a zombie searching for its missing toe, which is inside a stew that Auggie unwittingly eats. Auggie disappears after the zombie drags him under his bed. Realizing they are next, the remaining friends attempt to destroy the book; when this proves impossible, they research Sarah's life in hopes of finding a solution. A new story, \"The Red Spot\", is written. When Ruth discovers a swollen spider bite on her cheek, it explodes and releases hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized and placed in a mental institution.</p><p>The group's investigation takes them to a local hospital, where they discover that Sarah's brother performed electroshock therapy on her as part of a cover-up operation. The family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with mercury, and Sarah was tortured by her family for trying to reveal the truth, and blamed for the deed. At the hospital, Chuck is attacked by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his recurring nightmares, who absorbs him. Stella and Ram\u00f3n are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ram\u00f3n is a Vietnam War draft dodger. Ram\u00f3n reveals to Stella that it was out of fear after his brother enlisted and his dead body was returned to them in pieces. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ram\u00f3n realizes that the next creature will be the Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man kills Turner before attempting to kill Ram\u00f3n. Ram\u00f3n and Stella escape, and he lures the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to put an end to Sarah's actions.</p><p>Stella is taken back in time, living out part of Sarah's experience of the torture her family put her through. She promises Sarah's ghost that she will tell the real story of Sarah's life and the truth of her innocence if she stops harming people with her stories. Sarah forces her to write down the true story in blood before she and the Jangly Man vanish. Stella writes the truth about Sarah's life in the papers to the town keeping her promise. Ram\u00f3n accepts his enlistment and shares an emotional goodbye with Stella before he leaves for the war. Stella drives away with her father and a recovered Ruth, and states that she believes that they will find a way to rescue Chuck and Auggie as the film ends.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><h4>The Kids</h4><ul><li>Zoe Colletti as Stella Nicholls</li><li>Michael Garza as Ram\u00f3n Morales</li><li>Gabriel Rush as August \"Auggie\" Hilderbrandt</li><li>Austin Zajur as Charlie \"Chuck\" Steinberg</li><li>Natalie Ganzhorn as Ruth \"Ruthie\" Steinberg</li><li>Austin Abrams as Tommy Milner</li></ul><h4>Mill Valley Townspeople</h4><ul><li>Dean Norris as Roy Nicholls</li><li>Gil Bellows as Police Chief Turner</li><li>Lorraine Toussaint as Louise \"Lou Lou\" Baptiste Ajanae Stephenson as Young Louise Baptiste</li><li>Ajanae Stephenson as Young Louise Baptiste</li><li>Marie Ward as Mrs. Hilderbrandt</li><li>Deborah Pollitt as Mrs. Steinberg</li><li>Matt Smith as Mr. Steinberg</li><li>Karen Glave as Claire Baptiste</li><li>Kyle Labine as Deputy Hobbs</li><li>Victoria Fodor as Mrs. Milner</li></ul><h4>The Monsters</h4><ul><li>Javier Botet as Big Toe Corpse</li><li>Troy James as Jangly Man Andrew Jackson as the voice of the Jangly Man</li><li>Andrew Jackson as the voice of the Jangly Man</li><li>Mark Steger as Harold the Scarecrow and the Pale Lady</li></ul><h4>The Bellows Family</h4><ul><li>Kathleen Pollard as Sarah Bellows</li><li>Will Carr as Dr. Ephraim Bellows Elias Edraki as the voice of Dr. Ephraim Bellows</li><li>Elias Edraki as the voice of Dr. Ephraim Bellows</li><li>Jane Moffat as Delanie Bellows</li><li>Amanda Smith as Gertrude Bellows</li><li>Brandon Knox as Harold Bellows</li><li>Hume Baugh as Deodat Bellows</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>In 2013, CBS Films acquired the rights to the Alvin Schwartz's children's book series Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark from 1212 Entertainment, with the intent of producing it as a potential feature film.
