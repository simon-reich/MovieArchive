Ballard.\r\nThe film is set in a luxury tower block during the 1970s. Featuring a wealth of modern conveniences, the building allows its residents to become gradually uninterested in the outside world. The infrastructure begins to fail and tensions between residents become apparent, and the building soon descends into chaos.\r\nIn September 2015, the film received its world premi\u00e8re at the Toronto International Film Festival and its European premi\u00e8re at the 63rd San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2016 by StudioCanal. Though a critical success, the film's theatrical box office failed to meet its production costs. In 2017 it was nominated for the Empire Award for Best British Film.\r\nPlot\r\nThe film opens with Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) living in a ravaged high-rise tower block, killing a dog and spit-roasting its leg.\r\nThree months earlier, the forty-story tower on the outskirts of London, built by esteemed architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons), is the epitome of chic, modern living. Wealthier residents live on the top floors, and more common families below. With amenities including a pool, gym, supermarket, and even a primary school, the occupants have little reason to leave the building beyond working hours, and are increasingly isolated from the outside world.\r\nLaing moves onto the 25th floor after his sister dies. Beginning a relationship with single mother Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller) and becoming a fatherly figure to her son, Toby (Louis Suc), Laing befriends documentary filmmaker Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) and his pregnant wife Helen (Elisabeth Moss), who live in a low-level apartment with their children.\r\nWhile Laing leads a physiology class in examining a severed head, a student named Munrow (Augustus Prew) faints and is given a precautionary brain scan. The next day, Laing is taken to the 40th-story penthouse to meet Royal, and is invited to a party thrown by Royal's snobby wife, Ann (Keeley Hawes).\r\nThe gathering turns out to be an 18th-century costume party where Laing's everyday suit is ridiculed by Ann and other guests, including Munrow, who also lives in the building. Humiliated, Laing is thrown out and becomes trapped in an elevator during a power outage. Such outages are becoming common, along with water being shut off and garbage chutes becoming blocked, to the annoyance of lower-floor residents. Royal tells Laing these are simply growing pains of a new building.\r\nMunrow's brain scans come back clean, but a vengeful Laing leads him to believe he has a brain tumor. Another power outage ignites a night of decadent partying throughout the high-rise, and a drunk Munrow commits suicide by jumping off the 39th floor. Suspicious that no police arrive to investigate, Wilder becomes intent on exposing the injustices within the high-rise.\r\nLaw and order in the building disintegrate as violence becomes commonplace, food from the supermarket becomes scarce, and class warfare erupts between floors. It is implied that Royal has bribed authorities to ignore the disorder. Guilty over Munrow's death, Laing shows signs of mental disturbance, eventually barricading himself in his apartment and settling into the chaotic atmosphere, even having sex with Helen.\r\nWilder, waking up from a fight with upper-floor residents, intends to kill Royal, believing him responsible for the chaos. Acquiring a gun from the Royals' former housekeeper, Wilder learns that Charlotte is Royal's aide and Toby is Royal's illegitimate child. Breaking into Charlotte's apartment, Wilder tortures and rapes her for information on Royal. The only resident who still leaves for work, upper-floor resident and television newsreader Cosgrove (Peter Ferdinando), is captured and killed by a gang of lower-floor residents.\r\nSome upper-floor residents ask Laing to lobotomize Wilder as a dangerous agitator. After conducting a psychiatric examination, Laing refuses, stating that Wilder is \"possibly the sanest man in the building\", and is nearly thrown off the tower but Royal intervenes. He and Laing discuss the failure and arguable success of the high-rise as a \"crucible for change\" that could lead to \"new developments\", giving residents the opportunity to escape to a new life. The women at the top plan to establish new management of the building, and Helen gives birth to her overdue baby. Wilder makes his way to the penthouse, shooting Royal dead after a scuffle, and is killed by Royal's harem of women, as Toby looks on through his kaleidoscope.\r\nThe film ends as it began in the ravaged high-rise. Violence has abated somewhat with many residents dead and apartments in ruin. Laing appears to have gone insane, speaking about himself and to others in the third person and talking to the building. He lies down with Charlotte, reflecting that what has happened will eventually reach the second tower of the development. The film concludes with Toby listening to a radio broadcast of Margaret Thatcher declaring that where there is state capitalism there can never be political freedom.\r\nCast\r\nTom Hiddleston as Laing\r\nJeremy Irons as Royal\r\nSienna Miller as Charlotte\r\nLuke Evans as Wilder\r\nElisabeth Moss as Helen\r\nJames Purefoy as Pangbourne\r\nKeeley Hawes as Ann\r\nPeter Ferdinando as Cosgrove\r\nSienna Guillory as Jane\r\nReece Shearsmith as Steele\r\nEnzo Cilenti as Adrian Talbot\r\nAugustus Prew as Munrow\r\nDan Skinner as Simmons\r\nStacy Martin as Fay\r\nTony Way as Robert the Caretaker\r\nLeila Mimmack as Laura\r\nBill Paterson as Mercer\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nBritish producer Jeremy Thomas had wanted to make a film adaptation of J.G. Ballard's High-Rise since the 1970s. He tried to make it in the late 1970s with Nicolas Roeg directing from a script by Paul Mayersberg. In the 2000s, Thomas began developing the project with screenwriter Richard Stanley and director Vincenzo Natali, with the film intended as a loose adaptation of the novel.\r\nIn 2013, Wheatley started looking into who held the rights to the book, which led him to Thomas. Wheatley has remarked: \u201cThe book makes as much sense now as it did then. It was written in the '70s, projecting itself into a near future, but we live in that future now. We\u2019re almost in a new version of the '70s.\u201d\r\nScreenwriter Amy Jump, who is also Wheatley's wife, adapted the book.\r\nHiddleston's involvement in the project was announced in February 2014 after he was cast in the role of Dr. Robert Laing. Hiddleston had previously worked with Thomas on Jim Jarmusch's 2013 film Only Lovers Left Alive. The involvement of Luke Evans and Elisabeth Moss was announced that June.\r\nClint Mansell composed the soundtrack for the film.\r\nInternational sales were handled by HanWay Films, and key financiers included the British Film Institute and FilmFour.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in July 2014 in Belfast, primarily in the seaside resort town of Bangor, Co. Down.\r\nOn 3 July 2014, director Ben Wheatley tweeted pictures of the set. On 6 August 2014, Tom Hiddleston tweeted a photograph of himself from the set seen in character as Laing, together with Wheatley, Luke Evans and director of photography Laurie Rose.\r\nElisabeth Moss later remarked on Wheatley and the shoot: \"I don't know anyone who makes movies like he does... (it was) like if you gave him a bigger crew, a little bit more money, costumes and hair and makeup, all of that stuff that maybe he hasn't had before. It was so fun, he is just a fucking genius and he's so funny.\"\r\nRelease\r\nPrior to production on the film, it was announced that StudioCanal and The Jokers would be distributing the film in the United Kingdom and France respectively. In August 2015, it was announced that Soda Pictures would distribute the film in Canada. The film had its world premi\u00e8re at the Toronto International Film Festival on 13 September 2015. It had its international premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival on 21 September 2015. The film went onto screen at the London Film Festival on 9 October 2015, and the Torino Film Festival on 22 November 2015. Shortly after, it was announced Magnet Releasing had acquired the US distribution rights to the film. The film was released on 18 March 2016 in the United Kingdom. The film was released in the United States on 28 April 2016, with a day and date video on demand and theatrical limited release on 13 May 2016.\r\nThe film failed to recoup its production costs.\r\nCritical response\r\nThe critical response to the film is polarized. Tim Robey of The Telegraph awarded High-Rise 4 out of 5 stars, praising the brutality and dark comedy. IGN awarded it a score of 7.0 out of 10, saying \"Enjoyably dark and disturbing adaptation of one of J.G. Ballard's best.\" Kate Wilson of Varsity gave the film a 5-star review, calling it a \"masterpiece.\" Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 59% score based on 203 reviews and an average rating of 6.3/10; the site's consensus is \"High-Rise may not quite live up to its classic source material, but it still offers an energetic, well-acted, and thought-provoking take on its timely socioeconomic themes.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 65 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nAccolades",

Two miles west of London, Dr. Robert Laing moves into his new apartment seeking soulless anonymity, only to find that the building's residents have no intention of leaving him alone.

As he struggles to establish his position, Laing's good manners and sanity disintegrate along with the building. The lights go out and the lifts fail but the party goes on. People are the problem. Booze is the currency. Sex is the panacea. Only much later, as he sits on his balcony eating the architect's dog, does Dr. Robert Laing finally feel at home ...",
