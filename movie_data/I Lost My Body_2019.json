During a hair-raising escapade across the city, the extremity fends off pigeons and rats alike to reunite with pizza boy Naoufel. Its memories of Naoufel and his love for librarian Gabrielle may provide answers about what caused the hand's separation, and a poetic backdrop for a possible reunion between the three. Based on Guillaume Laurant's novel \"Happy Hand.\"",

The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 92nd Academy Awards, losing to Toy Story 4.\r\nIt was Xilam's first feature film to receive an R Rating from the Motion Picture Association.\r\nPlot\r\nThe film begins with a severed hand escaping from a refrigerator in a laboratory and beginning a journey across the suburbs of Paris to re-unite with its body, a young man named Naoufel. His story is told via flashbacks.\r\nAs a boy in Morocco, Naoufel aspires to be a pianist and an astronaut and records his day-to-day life on a tape recorder. During a car journey, he distracts his father while he was driving, causing a crash. He survives, but both of his parents are killed. He is forced to live in France with his emotionally distant uncle and his crude cousin. As a young adult, Naoufel works as a pizza deliveryman, often criticized by his boss for being late. On one occasion, Naoufel delivers a pizza to a young woman, Gabrielle, at her apartment block. They never see each other, as Naoufel is unable to get through the lobby's malfunctioning security door, but have a conversation through the intercom, and Naoufel becomes infatuated with her.\r\nNaoufel tracks Gabrielle to the library where she works and follows her to a nearby neighborhood where she drops off medicine to a carpenter, her uncle Gigi. Naoufel, seeing an ad for an apprentice in the window, quickly uses this as an excuse for why he is there. Gigi is reluctant but accepts after learning that Naoufel is an orphan. Naoufel moves out of his uncle's house and into an attic apartment provided by Gigi. He learns the tools of the trade and edges closer to Gabrielle, though he never mentions their first encounter.\r\nAfter a conversation about the arctic, Naoufel builds a wooden igloo on a rooftop of a nearby building for Gabrielle. Returning home one day, he finds his cousin talking to Gabrielle, and finds that he has invited them both to a party. That evening, Naoufel takes Gabrielle to the rooftops, where they discuss fate and Naoufel wonders if it can be changed by doing something unexpected, such as leaping from the roof onto a nearby crane. Naoufel shows Gabrielle the igloo he built and reveals that they had met before when he delivered pizza. Gabrielle is upset, fearing that Naoufel had taken advantage of Gigi solely in order to pursue her. Gabrielle leaves in a rage. Hurt, Naoufel goes to his cousin's party alone and gets into a drunken fight. The next morning, Naoufel goes to work hungover sporting a black eye. While cutting wood on a jigsaw, Naoufel is distracted by a fly and tries to catch it, snagging his watch on the blade and severing his hand.\r\nThe hand eventually reaches Naoufel and lies on his bed while he sleeps, but it can't re-attach itself and eventually hides under the bed. Naoufel, depressed and hopeless, revisits his old tape recorder, which still has recordings of his parents \u2013 including the fatal car ride. Gigi attempts to talk to him, but Naoufel doesn't respond. Gabrielle comes to see him and finds his room empty. Inside the cupboard, she finds an igloo that his severed hand had built out of sugar cubes. After searching the empty igloo on the roof, Gabrielle finds Naoufel's old, abandoned tape recorder and discovers a new recording on it. Listening, she learns he had leapt off the ledge and onto the crane as he had once discussed.\r\nAfter making the jump, Naoufel lies in the crane and smiles to himself as he looks out at the city. His severed hand retreats into the snow.\r\nCast\r\nRelease\r\nIn May 2019, following its Cannes premiere, Netflix acquired the worldwide distribution rights to the film, excluding France, Turkey, China and the Benelux region.\r\nThe film was released in France on 6 November 2019 by distributor Rezo Films. Netflix also gave the film a theatrical release in some countries, including the United States on 15 November and the United Kingdom on 22 November.\r\nReception\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 96% based on reviews from 72 critics. The site's consensus states, \"Beautifully animated and utterly unique, I Lost My Body takes audiences on a singularly strange journey whose unexpected contours lead to a wholly satisfying destination.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 80% based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nJordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \"A highly original and rather touching account of loss, both physical and emotional.\" Peter Debruge of Variety magazine wrote: \"I'd hazard to say it's one of the most original and creative animated features I've ever seen: macabre, of course \u2014 how could it be otherwise, given the premise? \u2014 but remarkably captivating and unexpectedly poetic in the process.\"\r\nAccolades",
