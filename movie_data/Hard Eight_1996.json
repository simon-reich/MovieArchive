It stars Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow and Samuel L. Jackson, with brief appearances by Robert Ridgely, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Walters.\r\nPlot\r\nSydney, a senior gambler, finds a young man, John, sitting forlornly at the diner, and offers to give him a cigarette and a cup of coffee. Sydney learns that John has lost the money, while gambling in a futile attempt to win $6,000 and pay for his mother's funeral. Sydney and John move to Las Vegas, in order to get a free room for the night. Though skeptical, John agrees to go. There, Sydney advances $150 to John and teaches him how to comp hustle the casino, by posing as a compulsive gambler with the amount money. John gets his free room, dinner and a pair of show tickets to boot. He is ecstatic, but Sydney points out that he has only solved his problem for a night.\r\nTwo years later, John has become Sydney's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and a successful gambler in Reno. He has made enough to pay for his mother's funeral. Sydney notes that John has become attracted to a casino cocktail waitress, Clementine. John introduces Sydney to Jimmy, who does internal security work at the casino. Jimmy speaks disrespectfully of women, and Sydney takes an instant dislike to him. Sydney and Clementine visit the diner, where he learns that she moonlights as a prostitute. Sydney gives her a good tip and leaves. It is near the end of Clementine's shift. Sydney does not go home, but waits outside until Clementine appears. She accompanies Sydney to the apartment he shares with John. There, Clementine is surprised that Sydney does not want to sleep with her. Instead, he makes her comfortable in John's room. He says that John will sleep elsewhere.\r\nThe next day, after reassuring an anxious John that he did not have sex with Clementine, Sydney sends the two to have them go shopping. That night, Sydney is wakened by a frantic phone call from John, who begs for his help, but will not tell Sydney what kind of help, or why it is needed. Sydney goes to the motel. He finds John and Clementine in one of the rooms, with a bleeding, unconscious man handcuffed to the bed. John says the man is a \"hostage.\" He was a client of Clementine's who refused to pay $300 for her. The tension is heightened, because John and Clementine called the hostage's wife to demand the money of her. Apart from that, the pair have no other plan of how to terminate the situation. John has a gun in his belt and Sydney asks him to hand it over. He opens the revolver and notes that it is unloaded.\r\nSydney tells them that the wife is not going to bring the money. She has probably already called the police and they are probably already on the way. Sydney says that they have got to leave, but Clementine cannot budge. She is not going to leave without the money. She will not listen to reason and John will not leave without her. He reveals that they got married today. Sydney tries a new tack, asking Clementine if she loves John. She nods in agreement.\r\nSydney moves about the room, clearing it of fingerprints and other evidence, as he calms the pair, telling John and Clementine to get out of town\u2014to head to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. He will notify the casino of their elopement and that Clementine will return to her job after the honeymoon. The man in the bed starts to waken. Sydney hits him on the head with a hard object and the man blacks out again. He persuades Clementine to give him the handcuff key, which he uses to free the man's hands. As they leave the room, John and Clementine head for Niagara Falls, while Sydney goes to the apartment. En route, he drops the gun and handcuff down a sewer. In the apartment he finds a threatening note from Jimmy, demanding that they meet.\r\nAt the meeting, Jimmy reveals that he had worked security in Atlantic City for the past years. He knew and heard something about certain mob figures. Jimmy knows that Sydney was then a mobster. He learned that Sydney killed John's father.

            "html": "<h2>Hard Eight (film)</h2><p>Hard Eight is a 1996 American crime film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in his feature directorial debut. It stars Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow and Samuel L. Jackson, with brief appearances by Robert Ridgely, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Walters.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Sydney, a senior gambler, finds a young man, John, sitting forlornly at the diner, and offers to give him a cigarette and a cup of coffee. Sydney learns that John has lost the money, while gambling in a futile attempt to win $6,000 and pay for his mother's funeral. Sydney and John move to Las Vegas, in order to get a free room for the night. Though skeptical, John agrees to go. There, Sydney advances $150 to John and teaches him how to comp hustle the casino, by posing as a compulsive gambler with the amount money. John gets his free room, dinner and a pair of show tickets to boot. He is ecstatic, but Sydney points out that he has only solved his problem for a night.</p><p>Two years later, John has become Sydney's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and a successful gambler in Reno. He has made enough to pay for his mother's funeral. Sydney notes that John has become attracted to a casino cocktail waitress, Clementine. John introduces Sydney to Jimmy, who does internal security work at the casino. Jimmy speaks disrespectfully of women, and Sydney takes an instant dislike to him. Sydney and Clementine visit the diner, where he learns that she moonlights as a prostitute. Sydney gives her a good tip and leaves. It is near the end of Clementine's shift. Sydney does not go home, but waits outside until Clementine appears. She accompanies Sydney to the apartment he shares with John. There, Clementine is surprised that Sydney does not want to sleep with her. Instead, he makes her comfortable in John's room. He says that John will sleep elsewhere.</p><p>The next day, after reassuring an anxious John that he did not have sex with Clementine, Sydney sends the two to have them go shopping. That night, Sydney is wakened by a frantic phone call from John, who begs for his help, but will not tell Sydney what kind of help, or why it is needed. Sydney goes to the motel. He finds John and Clementine in one of the rooms, with a bleeding, unconscious man handcuffed to the bed. John says the man is a \"hostage.\" He was a client of Clementine's who refused to pay $300 for her. The tension is heightened, because John and Clementine called the hostage's wife to demand the money of her. Apart from that, the pair have no other plan of how to terminate the situation. John has a gun in his belt and Sydney asks him to hand it over. He opens the revolver and notes that it is unloaded.</p><p>Sydney tells them that the wife is not going to bring the money. She has probably already called the police and they are probably already on the way. Sydney says that they have got to leave, but Clementine cannot budge. She is not going to leave without the money. She will not listen to reason and John will not leave without her. He reveals that they got married today. Sydney tries a new tack, asking Clementine if she loves John. She nods in agreement.</p><p>Sydney moves about the room, clearing it of fingerprints and other evidence, as he calms the pair, telling John and Clementine to get out of town\u2014to head to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. He will notify the casino of their elopement and that Clementine will return to her job after the honeymoon. The man in the bed starts to waken. Sydney hits him on the head with a hard object and the man blacks out again. He persuades Clementine to give him the handcuff key, which he uses to free the man's hands. As they leave the room, John and Clementine head for Niagara Falls, while Sydney goes to the apartment. En route, he drops the gun and handcuff down a sewer. In the apartment he finds a threatening note from Jimmy, demanding that they meet.</p><p>At the meeting, Jimmy reveals that he had worked security in Atlantic City for the past years. He knew and heard something about certain mob figures. Jimmy knows that Sydney was then a mobster. He learned that Sydney killed John's father.
