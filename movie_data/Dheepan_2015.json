Dheepan decides to flee, taking with him two strangers - a woman and a little girl - hoping that they will make it easier for him to claim asylum in Europe. Arriving in Paris, the 'family' moves from one temporary home to another until Dheepan finds work as the caretaker of a run-down housing block in the suburbs. He works to build a new life and a real home for his 'wife' and his 'daughter', but the daily violence he confronts quickly reopens his war wounds, and Dheepan is forced to reconnect with his warrior's instincts to protect the people he hopes will become his true family.",

After the armed conflict resolves, his side loses and he is forced to move to a refugee camp. There he decides to move to France to take a fresh chance at life. However, in order to secure political asylum, he requires a convincing cover story. He is given the passport of a dead man, Dheepan, and pairs with people he barely knows posing as his family. Along with his supposed wife, Yalini and his supposed 9-year-old daughter, Illayaal, they get on a ship bound for Paris. Upon arrival, he lands a job as a resident caretaker and starts building a new life in a housing project named Le Pr\u00e9 . He winds up as a caretaker of a rough housing project controlled by drug dealers (filmed on location in the peaceful project of La Coudraie, in the suburban city of Poissy). The new home turns out to be another conflict zone for him. Shootouts between rival drug gangs terrify Yalini and Illayaal as they try to fit into their roles as mother and daughter. Yalini is pressured to accept a job as a nurse-maid to the father of the local drug lord. Sivadhasan attends to his duties in spite of the chaos that surrounds him but is drawn into the fight. Caught in the crossfire of a climactic gunfight, Sivadhasan's latent battle-readiness resurfaces and he single-handedly destroys an entire gang with just a handgun, a machete and a screwdriver. He rescues Yalini from her boss's blood-soaked apartment. Eventually they all manage to immigrate to England where they find real peace.\r\nCast\r\nAntonythasan Jesuthasan as Dheepan/Sivadhasan\r\nKalieaswari Srinivasan as Yalini\r\nClaudine Vinasithamby as Illayaal\r\nVincent Rottiers as Brahim\r\nMarc Zinga as Youssouf\r\nFaouzi Bensa\u00efdi as Mr. Habib\r\nBass Dhem as Azziz\r\nFranck Falise as Janitor of Hallway C\r\nJos\u00e9phine de Meaux as Headmistress\r\nJean-Baptiste Pouilloux as Jurist\r\nNathan Anthonypillai as Interpreter\r\nVasanth Selvam as Colonel Cheran\r\nProduction\r\nDirector Jacques Audiard started making the film with the intent to make a variation of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 thriller Straw Dogs. But he wanted to set it in a community that no one in France knew much about.

During filming, Jesuthasan sometimes made corrections for accuracy.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nDheepan opened in France on 28 August 2015.
