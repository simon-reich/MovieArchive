In 2019, Esquire voted it the best film of the 2010s.\r\nPlot\r\nIn October 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his LiveJournal blog. He creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.\r\nZuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for Thefacebook, a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook.\r\nSaverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me\", a phrase which impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests renaming the site Facebook. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to Palo Alto, with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.\r\nWhile competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub, the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and decide to sue the company for theft of intellectual property. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel. Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg before being ejected from the building. Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. Later, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession at a party celebrating the 1 millionth user. He attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him.\r\nIn depositions, the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.\r\nCast\r\nJesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg\r\nAndrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin\r\nJustin Timberlake as Sean Parker\r\nArmie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss\r\nMax Minghella as Divya Narendra\r\nBrenda Song as Christy Lee\r\nRashida Jones as Marylin Delpy\r\nJohn Getz as Sy\r\nDavid Selby as Gage\r\nDenise Grayson as Gretchen\r\nDouglas Urbanski as Larry Summers\r\nRooney Mara as Erica Albright\r\nJoseph Mazzello as Dustin Moskovitz\r\nDustin Fitzsimons as The Phoenix \u2013 S K Club President\r\nWallace Langham as Peter Thiel\r\nPatrick Mapel as Chris Hughes\r\nDakota Johnson as Amelia Ritter\r\nMalese Jow as Alice Cantwel\r\nTrevor Wright as B.U. Guy in Bra\r\nShelby Young as K.C.\r\nAaron Sorkin as Ad Executive\r\nSteve Sires as Bill Gates\r\nCaleb Landry Jones as a fraternity brother\r\nJosh Pence is the body double for Hammer playing both twins; he also appears in a cameo role as the man being detoured from the bathroom by Zuckerberg and Saverin.\r\nProduction\r\nScreenplay\r\nScreenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, \"What attracted me to had nothing to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power.\" He said he read an unfinished draft of The Accidental Billionaires when the publisher began \"shopping it around\" for a film adaptation. According to Sorkin, \"I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything ... They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines.\"\r\nAccording to Sorkin, Mezrich did not send him material from his book as he wrote it: \"Two or three times we'd get together. I'd go to Boston, or we'd meet in New York and kind of compare notes and share information, but I didn't see the book until he was done with it. By the time I saw the book, I was probably 80 percent done with the screenplay.\" Sorkin elaborated:\r\nCasting\r\nCasting began in mid-2009, with Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield cast. Jonah Hill was in contention for Timberlake's role, but director David Fincher passed on him. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, \"Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you never have to worry about the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway \u2013 it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie\".\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in October 2009 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scenes were filmed around the campuses of two Massachusetts prep schools, Phillips Academy and Milton Academy. Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Wheelock College, which was set up to be Harvard's campus. (Harvard has turned down most requests for on-location filming ever since the filming of Love Story (1970), which caused significant physical damage to the campus.) Filming took place on the Keyser and Wyman quadrangles in the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University from November 2\u20134, which also doubled for Harvard in the film. The first scene in the film, where Zuckerberg is with his girlfriend, took 99 takes to finish. The film was shot on the Red One digital cinema camera. The rowing scenes with the Winklevoss brothers were filmed at Community Rowing Inc. in Newton, Massachusetts and at the Henley Royal Regatta; miniature faking process was used in a sequence showing a rowing event at the latter. Although a significant portion of the latter half of the film is set in Silicon Valley, the filmmakers opted to shoot those scenes in Los Angeles and Pasadena.\r\nArmie Hammer, who portrayed the Winklevoss twins, acted alongside body double Josh Pence while his scenes were filmed. His face was later digitally grafted onto Pence's face during post-production, while other scenes used split-screen photography. Pence was concerned about having no face time during the role, but after considerable musing thought of the role as a \"no-brainer\". He also appears in a cameo role elsewhere in the film. Hammer states that director David Fincher \"likes to push himself and likes to push technology\" and is \"one of the most technologically minded guys I've ever seen.\" This included sending the actors to \"twin boot camp\" for 10 months to learn everything about the Winklevosses.\r\nRowing production\r\nCommunity Rowing Inc. held a casting call and a tryout for 20 rowing extras; some were graduates from Harvard, Northeastern University, Boston University, George Washington University, and Trinity College, as well as local club rowers from Union Boat Club and Riverside Boat Club. None of the cast rowing extras for the Henley Royal Regatta racing scene appeared in the film; filming for the race was originally planned to take place in Los Angeles, but Fincher decided to film in New England during production.\r\nDavid Fincher hired Loyola Marymount coach Dawn Reagan to help train Josh Pence and Armie Hammer. While Hammer was new to the sport, Pence rowed previously at Dartmouth College.\r\nThe indoor rowing scene was filmed at Boston University's indoor rowing tanks. All of BU's blue oars in the scene were repainted to Harvard's crimson color for filming. Dan Boyne was the official rowing consultant in the US and the UK.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nOn June 1, 2010, it was announced that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would score the film. The soundtrack was released September 28 in various formats under the Null Corporation label. Leading up to the release of the soundtrack, a free five-track EP was made available for download. The White Stripes' song \"Ball and Biscuit\" can be heard in the opening of the film and The Beatles' song \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" concludes the film. Neither song appears on the soundtrack album.\r\nReznor and Ross won the award for Best Original Score at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards, as well as the 2011 Academy Award for Best Original Score.\r\nRelease\r\nPromotion\r\nPoster\r\nThe first theatrical poster, designed by Neil Kellerhouse, was released on June 18, 2010 As Kellerhouse previously designed posters for the films of Steven Soderbergh, director David Fincher's friend, he was contacted by Ce\u00e1n Chaffin in late 2009 to work on the key art for The Social Network, which had to make sole use of one approved photograph, that of Eisenberg's head. As he wanted to highlight the tremendous drama that went with Mark Zuckerberg's success, Kellerhouse thought of the tagline \"You don\u2019t get to 300 million friends without making a few enemies\u201d; he would later adjust the line to \"500 million friends\" in anticipation of Facebook reaching 500 million users by the film's release date. Kellerhouse's poster has been praised for its unique and \"striking\" design, and alongside his work for the film I'm Still Here, has since become highly influential in film marketing; posters for The King's Speech and The Armstrong Lie strongly evoked the poster's design format.\r\nTrailers\r\nThe film's first teaser trailer was released on June 25, 2010. The second teaser was released on July 8. The full length theatrical trailer debuted on July 16, 2010, which plays an edited version of the song \"Creep\", originally by Radiohead, covered by the Belgian choir group Scala & Kolacny Brothers. The trailer was then shown in theaters, prior to the films Inception, Dinner for Schmucks, Salt, Easy A, The Virginity Hit, and The Other Guys. The theatrical trailer, put together by Mark Woollen & Associates, won the Grand Key Art award at the 2011 Key Art Awards, sponsored by The Hollywood Reporter, and was also featured on The Film Informant's Perfect 10 Trailers in 2010.\r\nHome media\r\nThe Social Network was released on DVD and Blu-ray January 11, 2011. In its first week of release, DVD sales totaled $13,470,305 and it was the number-one-sold DVD of the week. The DVD includes an audio commentary with director David Fincher, and a second commentary with writer Aaron Sorkin and the cast. The Blu-ray and two-disc DVD releases include the commentaries, along with a feature-length documentary, How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook?, featurettes, Angus Wall, Kirk Baxter and Ren Klyce on Post, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and David Fincher on the Score, In the Hall of the Mountain King: Reznor's First Draft, Swarmatron, Jeff Cronenweth and David Fincher on the Visuals, and a Ruby Skye VIP Room: Multi-Angle Scene Breakdown feature.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nDuring its opening weekend in the United States, the film debuted at No. 1, grossing $22.4 million in 2,771 theaters. The film retained the top spot in its second weekend, dropping only 31.2%, breaking Inception's 32.0% record as the smallest second weekend drop for any number-one film of 2010, while being the third-smallest overall behind Secretariat's 25.1% drop and Tooth Fairy's 28.6% drop. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $97 million in the United States and $128 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $224.9 million.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 316 reviews, with an average rating of 9.01/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Impeccably scripted, beautifully directed, and filled with fine performances, The Social Network is a riveting, ambitious example of modern filmmaking at its finest.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 95 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" and making it one of the site's highest-rated movies of all time. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, giving it four stars and naming it the best film of the year, wrote: \"David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film his first full four-star rating of the year and said: \"The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade.\" The Harvard Crimson review called it \"flawless\" and gave it five stars. Quentin Tarantino listed The Social Network as one of his favorite 20 movies of the year, second to Toy Story 3.\r\nJoe Morgenstern in The Wall Street Journal praised the film as exhilarating but noted: \"The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book, Ben Mezrich's The Accidental Billionaires, so everything that's seen isn't necessarily to be believed.\"\r\nThe film won Best Picture from the National Board of Review, National Society of Film Critics, New York Film Critics Circle, and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, making it only the third film in history\u2014after Schindler's List (1993) and L.A. Confidential (1997)\u2014to sweep the \"Big Four\" critics awards. The film also won the \"Hollywood Ensemble Award\" from the Hollywood Film Awards. The Social Network appeared on 78 critics' top 10 lists for 2010; of those critics 22 had the film in their number one spot.\r\nIn August 2016, The Social Network was voted the 27th-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as voted on by 177 film critics from around the world.\r\nTop ten lists\r\nThe Social Network appeared on over 70 critics' top-ten lists of the best films of 2010.

In November 2009, executive producer Kevin Spacey said, \"The Social Network is probably going to be a lot funnier than people might expect it to be.\" The Cardinal Courier stated that the film was about \"greed, obsession, unpredictability and sex\" and asked, \"Although there are over 500 million Facebook users, does this mean Facebook can become a profitable blockbuster movie?\"\r\nAt the D8 conference hosted by D: All Things Digital on June 2, 2010, host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg she knew he was not happy with The Social Network being based on him, to which he replied, \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\" Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction, and that he had spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg said that instead of making Facebook to \"get girls\", he made it because he enjoyed \"building things\". He added that the film accurately depicted his wardrobe, saying, \"It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right\u2014like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own.\"\r\nFacebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz called the film a \"dramatization of history ... it is interesting to see my past rewritten in a way that emphasizes things that didn't matter, (like the Winklevosses, who I've still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past 6 years) and leaves out things that really did (like the many other people in our lives at the time, who supported us in innumerable ways).\" According to Moskovitz:\r\nCo-founder Eduardo Saverin said \"the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact-based documentary.\" Sorkin said: \"I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling. What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\"\r\nJournalist Jeff Jarvis acknowledged the film was \"well-crafted\" but called it \"the anti-social movie\", objecting to Sorkin's decision to change various events and characters for dramatic effect, and dismissing it as \"the story that those who resist the change society is undergoing want to see.\" Technology broadcaster Leo Laporte concurred, calling the film \"anti-geek and misogynistic\". Sorkin responded to these allegations by saying, \"I was writing about a very angry and deeply misogynistic group of people\".\r\nAndrew Clark of The Guardian wrote that \"there's something insidious about this genre of scriptwriting,\" wondering if \"a 26-year-old businessman really deserves to have his name dragged through the mud in a murky mixture of fact and imagination for the general entertainment of the movie-viewing public?\" Clark added, \"I'm not sure whether Mark Zuckerberg is a punk, a genius or both. But I won't be seeing The Social Network to find out.\"\r\nSeveral noteworthy tech journalists and bloggers voiced their opinions of how the film portrays its real-life characters. Mashable founder and CEO Pete Cashmore, blogging for CNN, said: \"If the Facebook founder is concerned about being represented as anything but a genius with an industrious work ethic, he can breathe a sigh of relief.\" Jessi Hempel, a technology writer for Fortune who says she's known Zuckerberg \"for a long time\", wrote of the film:\r\nHarvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig wrote in The New Republic that Sorkin's screenplay does not acknowledge the \"real villain\" of the story:\r\nIn an onstage discussion with The Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington, during Advertising Week 2010 in New York, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said she had seen the film and it was \"very Hollywood\" and mainly \"fiction\". \"In real life, he was just sitting around with his friends in front of his computer, ordering pizza,\" she declared. \"Who wants to go see that for two hours?\"\r\nDivya Narendra said that he was \"initially surprised\" to see himself portrayed by the non-Indian actor Max Minghella, but also admitted that the actor did a \"good job in pushing the dialogue forward and creating a sense of urgency in what was a very frustrating period.\"\r\nThe visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 76.1% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarizing it as \"mostly true, bar some crude characterization of Zuckerberg as a cold hypergeek on a quest for status\".\r\nImpact\r\nSince its release, The Social Network has been cited as inspiring involvement in start-ups and social media. Bob Lefsetz has stated that: \"watching this movie makes you want to run from the theatre, grab your laptop and build your own empire,\" noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that \"techies have become the new rock stars.\" This has led Dave Knox to comment that: \"fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs.\" After seeing the movie, Zuckerberg was quoted as saying he is \"interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship\", noting that he gets \"lots of messages from people who claim that they have been very much inspired... to start their own company.\" Saverin echoed these sentiments, stating that the film may inspire \"countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business.\" In one such instance, the co-founders of Wall Street Magnate confirmed that they were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network.\r\nFollowing his success with the film, Sorkin became attached to another project about a technology company, writing the script for the 2015 biopic Steve Jobs, which used a similar format. Another Facebook film may be produced, as the company's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, has signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to develop her new book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, into a movie.\r\nSequel\r\nIn January 2019, Sorkin sat down for an interview with AP Entertainment and revealed Rudin has been consistently pushing for the development of a screenplay for a sequel, saying, \"First of all, I know a lot more about Facebook in 2005 than I do in 2018, but I know enough to know that there should be a sequel. A lot of very interesting, dramatic stuff has happened since the movie ends with settling the lawsuit from the Winklevoss twins and Eduardo Saverin.\"",
            "html": "<h2>The Social Network</h2><p>The Social Network is a 2010 American biographical drama film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires, it portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits. It stars Jesse Eisenberg as founder Mark Zuckerberg, along with Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Max Minghella as Divya Narendra. Neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project, although Saverin was a consultant for Mezrich's book. The film was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 1, 2010.</p><p>The Social Network garnered acclaim for its direction, screenplay, acting, editing, and score. It was named one of the best films of the year by 78 critics, and named the best by 22 critics, the most of any film that year. It was also chosen by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2010. At the 83rd Academy Awards, it received eight nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Eisenberg, and won three: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing. It also received awards for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. In 2016, it was voted 27th among 100 films considered the best of the 21st century by 117 film international critics. In 2019, Esquire voted it the best film of the 2010s.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In October 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his LiveJournal blog. He creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.</p><p>Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for Thefacebook, a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook.</p><p>Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me\", a phrase which impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests renaming the site Facebook. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to Palo Alto, with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.</p><p>While competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub, the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and decide to sue the company for theft of intellectual property. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel. Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg before being ejected from the building. Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. Later, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession at a party celebrating the 1 millionth user. He attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him.</p><p>In depositions, the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg</li><li>Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin</li><li>Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker</li><li>Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss</li><li>Max Minghella as Divya Narendra</li><li>Brenda Song as Christy Lee</li><li>Rashida Jones as Marylin Delpy</li><li>John Getz as Sy</li><li>David Selby as Gage</li><li>Denise Grayson as Gretchen</li><li>Douglas Urbanski as Larry Summers</li><li>Rooney Mara as Erica Albright</li><li>Joseph Mazzello as Dustin Moskovitz</li><li>Dustin Fitzsimons as The Phoenix \u2013 S K Club President</li><li>Wallace Langham as Peter Thiel</li><li>Patrick Mapel as Chris Hughes</li><li>Dakota Johnson as Amelia Ritter</li><li>Malese Jow as Alice Cantwel</li><li>Trevor Wright as B.U.

The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power.\" He said he read an unfinished draft of The Accidental Billionaires when the publisher began \"shopping it around\" for a film adaptation. According to Sorkin, \"I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything ... They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines.\"</p><p>According to Sorkin, Mezrich did not send him material from his book as he wrote it: \"Two or three times we'd get together. I'd go to Boston, or we'd meet in New York and kind of compare notes and share information, but I didn't see the book until he was done with it. By the time I saw the book, I was probably 80 percent done with the screenplay.\" Sorkin elaborated:</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: top; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201c</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;\">There's a lot of available research, and I also did a lot of first person research with a number of the people that were involved in the story. I can't go too deeply into that because most of the people did it on the condition of anonymity, but what I found was that two lawsuits were brought against Facebook at roughly the same time, that the defendant, plaintiffs, witnesses all came into a deposition room and swore under oath, and three different versions of the story were told. Instead of choosing one and deciding that's the truest one or choosing one and deciding that's the juiciest one, I decided to dramatize the idea that there were three different versions of the story being told. That's how I came up with the structure of the deposition room.</td><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: bottom; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: right; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Casting</h4><p>Casting began in mid-2009, with Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield cast. Jonah Hill was in contention for Timberlake's role, but director David Fincher passed on him. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, \"Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you never have to worry about the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway \u2013 it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie\".</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began in October 2009 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scenes were filmed around the campuses of two Massachusetts prep schools, Phillips Academy and Milton Academy. Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Wheelock College, which was set up to be Harvard's campus. (Harvard has turned down most requests for on-location filming ever since the filming of Love Story (1970), which caused significant physical damage to the campus.) Filming took place on the Keyser and Wyman quadrangles in the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University from November 2\u20134, which also doubled for Harvard in the film. The first scene in the film, where Zuckerberg is with his girlfriend, took 99 takes to finish. The film was shot on the Red One digital cinema camera. The rowing scenes with the Winklevoss brothers were filmed at Community Rowing Inc. in Newton, Massachusetts and at the Henley Royal Regatta; miniature faking process was used in a sequence showing a rowing event at the latter. Although a significant portion of the latter half of the film is set in Silicon Valley, the filmmakers opted to shoot those scenes in Los Angeles and Pasadena.</p><p>Armie Hammer, who portrayed the Winklevoss twins, acted alongside body double Josh Pence while his scenes were filmed. His face was later digitally grafted onto Pence's face during post-production, while other scenes used split-screen photography. Pence was concerned about having no face time during the role, but after considerable musing thought of the role as a \"no-brainer\". He also appears in a cameo role elsewhere in the film. Hammer states that director David Fincher \"likes to push himself and likes to push technology\" and is \"one of the most technologically minded guys I've ever seen.\" This included sending the actors to \"twin boot camp\" for 10 months to learn everything about the Winklevosses.</p><h4>Rowing production</h4><p>Community Rowing Inc. held a casting call and a tryout for 20 rowing extras; some were graduates from Harvard, Northeastern University, Boston University, George Washington University, and Trinity College, as well as local club rowers from Union Boat Club and Riverside Boat Club. None of the cast rowing extras for the Henley Royal Regatta racing scene appeared in the film; filming for the race was originally planned to take place in Los Angeles, but Fincher decided to film in New England during production.</p><p>David Fincher hired Loyola Marymount coach Dawn Reagan to help train Josh Pence and Armie Hammer. While Hammer was new to the sport, Pence rowed previously at Dartmouth College.</p><p>The indoor rowing scene was filmed at Boston University's indoor rowing tanks. All of BU's blue oars in the scene were repainted to Harvard's crimson color for filming. Dan Boyne was the official rowing consultant in the US and the UK.</p><h4>Soundtrack</h4><p>On June 1, 2010, it was announced that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would score the film. The soundtrack was released September 28 in various formats under the Null Corporation label. Leading up to the release of the soundtrack, a free five-track EP was made available for download. The White Stripes' song \"Ball and Biscuit\" can be heard in the opening of the film and The Beatles' song \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" concludes the film. Neither song appears on the soundtrack album.</p><p>Reznor and Ross won the award for Best Original Score at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards, as well as the 2011 Academy Award for Best Original Score.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Promotion</h4><h4>Poster</h4><p>The first theatrical poster, designed by Neil Kellerhouse, was released on June 18, 2010 As Kellerhouse previously designed posters for the films of Steven Soderbergh, director David Fincher's friend, he was contacted by Ce\u00e1n Chaffin in late 2009 to work on the key art for The Social Network, which had to make sole use of one approved photograph, that of Eisenberg's head. As he wanted to highlight the tremendous drama that went with Mark Zuckerberg's success, Kellerhouse thought of the tagline \"You don\u2019t get to 300 million friends without making a few enemies\u201d; he would later adjust the line to \"500 million friends\" in anticipation of Facebook reaching 500 million users by the film's release date. Kellerhouse's poster has been praised for its unique and \"striking\" design, and alongside his work for the film I'm Still Here, has since become highly influential in film marketing; posters for The King's Speech and The Armstrong Lie strongly evoked the poster's design format.</p><h4>Trailers</h4><p>The film's first teaser trailer was released on June 25, 2010. The second teaser was released on July 8. The full length theatrical trailer debuted on July 16, 2010, which plays an edited version of the song \"Creep\", originally by Radiohead, covered by the Belgian choir group Scala & Kolacny Brothers. The trailer was then shown in theaters, prior to the films Inception, Dinner for Schmucks, Salt, Easy A, The Virginity Hit, and The Other Guys. The theatrical trailer, put together by Mark Woollen & Associates, won the Grand Key Art award at the 2011 Key Art Awards, sponsored by The Hollywood Reporter, and was also featured on The Film Informant's Perfect 10 Trailers in 2010.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>The Social Network was released on DVD and Blu-ray January 11, 2011. In its first week of release, DVD sales totaled $13,470,305 and it was the number-one-sold DVD of the week. The DVD includes an audio commentary with director David Fincher, and a second commentary with writer Aaron Sorkin and the cast. The Blu-ray and two-disc DVD releases include the commentaries, along with a feature-length documentary, How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook?, featurettes, Angus Wall, Kirk Baxter and Ren Klyce on Post, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and David Fincher on the Score, In the Hall of the Mountain King: Reznor's First Draft, Swarmatron, Jeff Cronenweth and David Fincher on the Visuals, and a Ruby Skye VIP Room: Multi-Angle Scene Breakdown feature.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>During its opening weekend in the United States, the film debuted at No. 1, grossing $22.4 million in 2,771 theaters. The film retained the top spot in its second weekend, dropping only 31.2%, breaking Inception's 32.0% record as the smallest second weekend drop for any number-one film of 2010, while being the third-smallest overall behind Secretariat's 25.1% drop and Tooth Fairy's 28.6% drop. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $97 million in the United States and $128 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $224.9 million.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 316 reviews, with an average rating of 9.01/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Impeccably scripted, beautifully directed, and filled with fine performances, The Social Network is a riveting, ambitious example of modern filmmaking at its finest.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 95 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" and making it one of the site's highest-rated movies of all time. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.</p><p>Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, giving it four stars and naming it the best film of the year, wrote: \"David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film his first full four-star rating of the year and said: \"The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade.\" The Harvard Crimson review called it \"flawless\" and gave it five stars. Quentin Tarantino listed The Social Network as one of his favorite 20 movies of the year, second to Toy Story 3.</p><p>Joe Morgenstern in The Wall Street Journal praised the film as exhilarating but noted: \"The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book, Ben Mezrich's The Accidental Billionaires, so everything that's seen isn't necessarily to be believed.\"</p><p>The film won Best Picture from the National Board of Review, National Society of Film Critics, New York Film Critics Circle, and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, making it only the third film in history\u2014after Schindler's List (1993) and L.A. Confidential (1997)\u2014to sweep the \"Big Four\" critics awards. The film also won the \"Hollywood Ensemble Award\" from the Hollywood Film Awards. The Social Network appeared on 78 critics' top 10 lists for 2010; of those critics 22 had the film in their number one spot.</p><p>In August 2016, The Social Network was voted the 27th-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as voted on by 177 film critics from around the world.</p><h4>Top ten lists</h4><p>The Social Network appeared on over 70 critics' top-ten lists of the best films of 2010.

In November 2009, executive producer Kevin Spacey said, \"The Social Network is probably going to be a lot funnier than people might expect it to be.\" The Cardinal Courier stated that the film was about \"greed, obsession, unpredictability and sex\" and asked, \"Although there are over 500 million Facebook users, does this mean Facebook can become a profitable blockbuster movie?\"</p><p>At the D8 conference hosted by D: All Things Digital on June 2, 2010, host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg she knew he was not happy with The Social Network being based on him, to which he replied, \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\" Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction, and that he had spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg said that instead of making Facebook to \"get girls\", he made it because he enjoyed \"building things\". He added that the film accurately depicted his wardrobe, saying, \"It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right\u2014like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own.\"</p><p>Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz called the film a \"dramatization of history ... it is interesting to see my past rewritten in a way that emphasizes things that didn't matter, (like the Winklevosses, who I've still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past 6 years) and leaves out things that really did (like the many other people in our lives at the time, who supported us in innumerable ways).\" According to Moskovitz:</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: top; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201c</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;\">A lot of exciting things happened in 2004, but mostly we just worked a lot and stressed out about things; the version in the trailer seems a lot more exciting, so I'm just going to choose to remember that we drank ourselves silly and had a lot of sex with coeds. ... The plot of the book/script unabashedly attacked, but I actually felt like a lot of his positive qualities come out truthfully in the trailer (soundtrack aside). At the end of the day, they cannot help but portray him as the driven, forward-thinking genius that he is.</td><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: bottom; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: right; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Co-founder Eduardo Saverin said \"the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact-based documentary.\" Sorkin said: \"I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling. What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\"</p><p>Journalist Jeff Jarvis acknowledged the film was \"well-crafted\" but called it \"the anti-social movie\", objecting to Sorkin's decision to change various events and characters for dramatic effect, and dismissing it as \"the story that those who resist the change society is undergoing want to see.\" Technology broadcaster Leo Laporte concurred, calling the film \"anti-geek and misogynistic\". Sorkin responded to these allegations by saying, \"I was writing about a very angry and deeply misogynistic group of people\".</p><p>Andrew Clark of The Guardian wrote that \"there's something insidious about this genre of scriptwriting,\" wondering if \"a 26-year-old businessman really deserves to have his name dragged through the mud in a murky mixture of fact and imagination for the general entertainment of the movie-viewing public?\" Clark added, \"I'm not sure whether Mark Zuckerberg is a punk, a genius or both. But I won't be seeing The Social Network to find out.\"</p><p>Several noteworthy tech journalists and bloggers voiced their opinions of how the film portrays its real-life characters. Mashable founder and CEO Pete Cashmore, blogging for CNN, said: \"If the Facebook founder is concerned about being represented as anything but a genius with an industrious work ethic, he can breathe a sigh of relief.\" Jessi Hempel, a technology writer for Fortune who says she's known Zuckerberg \"for a long time\", wrote of the film:</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: top; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201c</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;\">The real-life Zuckerberg was maniacally focused on building a web site that could potentially connect everyone on the planet...By contrast, in the film he seems more obsessed with achieving the largesse that bad boy <span>Sean Parker</span>, an original <span>Napster</span> founder, portrays when he arrives to meet Zuckerberg at a New York restaurant.</td><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: bottom; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: right; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig wrote in The New Republic that Sorkin's screenplay does not acknowledge the \"real villain\" of the story:</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: top; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201c</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;\">The total and absolute absurdity of the world where the engines of a federal lawsuit get cranked up to adjudicate the hurt feelings (because \"our idea was stolen!\") of entitled Harvard undergraduates is completely missed by Sorkin. We can't know enough from the film to know whether there was actually any substantial legal claim here. Sorkin has been upfront about the fact that there are fabrications aplenty lacing the story. But from the story as told, we certainly know enough to know that any legal system that would allow these kids to extort $65 million from the most successful business this century should be ashamed of itself. Did Zuckerberg breach his contract? Maybe, for which the damages are more like $650, not $65 million. Did he steal a trade secret? Absolutely not. Did he steal any other \"property\"? Absolutely not\u2014the code for Facebook was his, and the \"idea\" of a social network is not a patent. It wasn't justice that gave the twins $65 million; it was the fear of a random and inefficient system of law. That system is a tax on innovation and creativity. That tax is the real villain here, not the innovator it burdened.</td><td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: bottom; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: right; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In an onstage discussion with The Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington, during Advertising Week 2010 in New York, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said she had seen the film and it was \"very Hollywood\" and mainly \"fiction\". \"In real life, he was just sitting around with his friends in front of his computer, ordering pizza,\" she declared. \"Who wants to go see that for two hours?\"</p><p>Divya Narendra said that he was \"initially surprised\" to see himself portrayed by the non-Indian actor Max Minghella, but also admitted that the actor did a \"good job in pushing the dialogue forward and creating a sense of urgency in what was a very frustrating period.\"</p><p>The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 76.1% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarizing it as \"mostly true, bar some crude characterization of Zuckerberg as a cold hypergeek on a quest for status\".</p><h4>Impact</h4><p>Since its release, The Social Network has been cited as inspiring involvement in start-ups and social media. Bob Lefsetz has stated that: \"watching this movie makes you want to run from the theatre, grab your laptop and build your own empire,\" noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that \"techies have become the new rock stars.\" This has led Dave Knox to comment that: \"fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs.\" After seeing the movie, Zuckerberg was quoted as saying he is \"interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship\", noting that he gets \"lots of messages from people who claim that they have been very much inspired... to start their own company.\" Saverin echoed these sentiments, stating that the film may inspire \"countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business.\" In one such instance, the co-founders of Wall Street Magnate confirmed that they were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network.</p><p>Following his success with the film, Sorkin became attached to another project about a technology company, writing the script for the 2015 biopic Steve Jobs, which used a similar format. Another Facebook film may be produced, as the company's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, has signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to develop her new book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, into a movie.</p><br/><h3>Sequel</h3><p>In January 2019, Sorkin sat down for an interview with AP Entertainment and revealed Rudin has been consistently pushing for the development of a screenplay for a sequel, saying, \"First of all, I know a lot more about Facebook in 2005 than I do in 2018, but I know enough to know that there should be a sequel. A lot of very interesting, dramatic stuff has happened since the movie ends with settling the lawsuit from the Winklevoss twins and Eduardo Saverin.\"</p><br/>"
