High Life had its world premiere on 9 September 2018 at the Toronto International Film Festival.\r\nPlot\r\nA group of criminals serving death sentences are sent on an alternative-energy-finding mission in space to extract energy from a black hole. Each prisoner is treated as a guinea pig by Dr. Dibs, who is fixated on creating a child through artificial insemination, but has yet to find success. Sexual activity between prisoners is prohibited. The ship is equipped with \"The Box,\" a device obsessively used by the crew to masturbate. Dibs murdered her own children and husband before attempting suicide. Monte, the only celibate prisoner, rejects Dibs' sexual advances. Monte is serving a life sentence for killing his friend for murdering his dog as a child. Monte's only friend on the ship is Tcherny, who is drawn to the onboard garden because it reminds him of Earth.\r\nPregnant prisoner Elektra delivers a baby, but it dies, and later she does as well. The captain, Chandra, develops leukemia due to radiation and has a stroke before being euthanized by Dibs. One night, male prisoner Ettore binds a female prisoner named Boyse and her roommate Mink to their beds and attempts to rape Boyse. Nansen, the pilot, intervenes, but Ettore attacks and overpowers her. Monte arrives, throws Ettore off Boyse, and beats him. When Monte leads Boyse away to be treated, Mink stabs Ettore to death in the hallway. Dibs begins doubling the amount of sedatives each prisoner receives, later sneaking into Monte's cell and raping him while he is sedated. She then injects his semen into Boyse, who produces a healthy child that Dibs dotes on, but Monte is unaware that he is the baby's father.\r\nAs the ship approaches the black hole, Nansen prepares to take a shuttle into it. Unbeknownst to the other prisoners, Boyse kills Nansen with a shovel and takes her place. The shuttle travels through a molecular cloud that alters its trajectory and causes it to dive into the black hole, where Boyse explodes due to spaghettification. Mink later attacks Dibs and injures her, but is then killed by Monte. Dibs informs Monte that the child is his before ejecting herself into space. Tcherny commits suicide and Monte buries him in the garden according to his wishes. Now the only surviving prisoner, Monte removes the bodies from the ship's morgue, dresses them in spacesuits, and releases them into space.\r\nMonte struggles to raise the baby, whom he has named Willow. He attempts to make repairs to the ship, but her frantic cries through his helmet speakers causes him to drop a tool and lose it in space. Much later, when Willow has grown into a teenager, they encounter another ship similar to their own. Monte boards the ship, but finds it carrying stray dogs who have survived by eating one another. Willow begs Monte to bring one back, but he refuses, implying contamination could potentially sicken or kill them. The ship moves closer to the black hole, and Willow convinces Monte to board a shuttle with her and journey through it. Monte takes Willow's hand as a yellow light source grows ever larger and envelops them.\r\nCast\r\nRobert Pattinson as Monte Miko\u0142aj Gruss as young Monte\r\nMiko\u0142aj Gruss as young Monte\r\nJuliette Binoche as Dibs\r\nAndr\u00e9 Benjamin as Tcherny\r\nMia Goth as Boyse\r\nAgata Buzek as Nansen\r\nLars Eidinger as Chandra\r\nClaire Tran as Mink\r\nEwan Mitchell as Ettore\r\nGloria Obianyo as Elektra\r\nVictor Banerjee as Indian Professor\r\nJessie Ross as Willow Scarlette Lindsey as baby Willow Joni Brauer and Johann Bartlitz as newborn Willow\r\nScarlette Lindsey as baby Willow\r\nJoni Brauer and Johann Bartlitz as newborn Willow\r\nProduction\r\nClaire Denis had the idea of the project in her mind for fifteen years. Talking about it she said that, \"I had a screenplay which was naturally in English, because the story takes place in space and, I don't know why, but for me, people speak English \u2013 or Russian or Chinese \u2013 but definitely not French in space.\"\r\nInitially novelist Nick Laird co-wrote the screenplay for the film along with Denis, Fargeau and Geoff Cox. Additionally, Laird's wife Zadie Smith contributed to early drafts of the English version of the screenplay. Due to creative differences between Denis and Smith, Laird and Smith dropped out of the project as screenwriters, but Laird later served as the consultant for the script.\r\nDenis went to the European Space Agency's Astronaut Centre in Cologne to learn about human spaceflight exploration before the film started shooting.\r\nDenis explained the practical reasons for the non-linear story, saying \"I always wanted it to start with a man and a baby, as a ritual of two living persons with no despair in that moment. And then there would be the flashbacks bringing in all the despair.\" Denis compared Pattinson's character to the knight Percival of Arthurian legend, and Binoche's character to Medea from the Greek tragedy.\r\nCasting\r\nDuring the project's early stages, Denis had Vincent Gallo in mind for the lead role, and wrote the film thinking of Philip Seymour Hoffman. The project later caught the attention of Robert Pattinson; according to Denis:\r\nPattinson contacted the person who was doing the English casting. I was intrigued but I thought he was too young. Every time I went to London to meet some actors, he was there. His desire to work with me has never faltered. And now he is a little less young and it's perfect. It's strange, though, because it would be difficult to imagine anyone more unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman physically, but Robert is very enigmatic, with a powerful presence. He gives off an aura that immediately makes you want to film him.\r\nPattinson described his character as an astronaut and said, \"he's a criminal who volunteers for a mission toward a black hole, but he realizes along the way that a doctor on board also wants to do sexual experimentation with humans in space.\" In late 2015, Patricia Arquette and Mia Goth joined the cast. In September 2017, Arquette dropped out while the rest of the cast, including Juliette Binoche and rapper Andr\u00e9 3000, were also announced.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography for the film began in Cologne, Germany on 4 September 2017. The Polish part of the shooting took place in Bia\u0142ystok. Filming wrapped up in late October 2017.\r\nRelease\r\nFollowing its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, the film competed in main competition at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival in late September 2018. The film had its theatrical release in France on 7 November 2018 and in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2019. A24 acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. The film was released in the United States on 5 April 2019.\r\nCritical reception\r\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 7.51/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"High Life is as visually arresting as it is challenging, confounding, and ultimately rewarding \u2013 which is to say it's everything film fans expect from director Claire Denis.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an A\u2212 grade, saying it owed more to Solaris than Star Wars and describing it as \"a pensive and profound study of human life on the brink of the apocalypse.\" Jessica Kiang of Variety called it \"extraordinary, difficult, hypnotic, and repulsive\". Charles Bramesco of the Guardian gave the film 5 stars out of 5, saying Denis had reconfigured the genre's \"familiar components to create a startlingly fresh engagement with the question of what it means to be human.\" Steve MacFarlane of Slant Magazine wrote: \"The film asks down-and-dirty questions about what really resides beneath thousands of years of human progress, a savage and haunting antidote to the high-minded idealism of movies like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Ridley Scott's The Martian.\"\r\nIn France, Le Monde and Lib\u00e9ration described High Life as a \"masterpiece\".\r\nAccolades",
