Budd has been warned by Bill of her approach; he incapacitates her with a non-lethal shotgun blast of rock salt and sedates her. He calls Elle Driver, another former Deadly Viper, and arranges to sell her the Bride's unique sword for $1 million. He seals the Bride inside a coffin and buries her alive.\r\nYears earlier, Bill tells the young Bride of the legendary martial arts master Pai Mei and his Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, a death blow that Mei refuses to teach his students; the technique that supposedly kills any opponent after they have taken five steps. Bill takes the Bride to Mei's temple for training. Mei ridicules her and makes her training a torment, but she gains his respect. In the present, the Bride uses Mei's techniques to break out of the coffin and claw her way to the surface.\r\nElle arrives at Budd's trailer and kills him with a black mamba hidden with the money for the sword. She calls Bill and tells him that the Bride has killed Budd and that she has killed the Bride, using the Bride's real name: Beatrix Kiddo. As Elle exits the trailer, Beatrix ambushes her and they fight. Elle, who was also taught by Mei, taunts Beatrix by revealing that she killed Mei by poisoning him in retribution for him plucking out her eye. An enraged Beatrix plucks out Elle's remaining eye and leaves her screaming in the trailer with the black mamba.\r\nIn Acu\u00f1a, Mexico, Beatrix meets a retired pimp, Esteban Vihaio, who helps her find Bill. She tracks him to a hotel, and discovers that their daughter B.B. is still alive, now four years old, spending the evening with them. After she puts B.B. to bed, Bill shoots Beatrix with a dart containing truth serum and interrogates her. She recounts a mission in which she discovered she was pregnant and explains that she left the Deadly Vipers to give B.B. a better life. Bill explains that he assumed she had died and mourned her for three months; he ordered her assassination when he discovered she was alive and engaged to a \"jerk\" that he assumed was the father of her child. Beatrix disables Bill and strikes with Mei's Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, which she had kept secret. Bill makes his peace with her, takes five steps and dies. Beatrix leaves with B.B. to start a new life.\r\nCast\r\nUma Thurman as The Bride / Beatrix Kiddo (Black Mamba): A former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who is described as \"the deadliest woman in the world\". She is targeted by her former allies in the wedding chapel massacre, and falls into a coma. When she awakens four years later, she embarks on a deadly trail of revenge against the perpetrators of the massacre.\r\nDavid Carradine as Bill (Snake Charmer): The former leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. He is also the former lover of Beatrix and the father of her daughter. He is the final and eponymous target of Beatrix's revenge.\r\nMichael Madsen as Budd (Sidewinder): A former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and brother of Bill. He later becomes a bouncer living in a trailer. He is the third of Beatrix's revenge targets.\r\nDaryl Hannah as Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake): A former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She is the fourth of Beatrix's revenge targets.\r\nGordon Liu as Pai Mei: An immensely powerful and extremely old martial arts master. Bill, Beatrix, and Elle all train under him. Liu had appeared in Volume 1 as Johnny Mo, leader of the Yakuza gang The Crazy 88's.\r\nMichael Parks as Esteban Vihaio: A retired pimp. He was the first of Bill's \u201cfather figures\u201d. Beatrix comes to him asking for Bill's whereabouts. Like Gordon Liu, Parks appeared in the first film as a different character, Texas Ranger Earl McGraw.\r\nStephanie L. Moore, Shana Stein, and Caitlin Keats as Joleen, Erica, and Janeen: Beatrix's best friends who are present at the wedding rehearsal.\r\nBo Svenson as Reverend Harmony: The minister who was to officiate at Beatrix and Tommy's wedding.\r\nJeannie Epper as Mrs. Harmony: Reverend Harmony's wife.\r\nChris Nelson as Tommy Plympton: Beatrix's fianc\u00e9 who is killed in the wedding chapel massacre.\r\nSamuel L. Jackson as Rufus: The organist who was to perform at Beatrix and Tommy's wedding.\r\nLarry Bishop as Larry Gomez: The abusive manager of the strip club at which Budd works.\r\nSid Haig as Jay: An employee at the strip club where Budd works.\r\nPerla Haney-Jardine as BB: The daughter of Beatrix and Bill.

She later becomes \"Queen of the Tokyo Underworld\". She is the first of Beatrix's revenge targets.\r\nVivica A.

She is also a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bill's, and was present at the wedding chapel massacre.\r\nSonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo: Revered as the greatest swordsmith of all time. Although long retired, he agrees to craft a sword for Beatrix.\r\nMusic\r\nAs with Tarantino's previous films, Kill Bill features an eclectic soundtrack comprising many musical genres. On the two soundtracks, music ranges from country music to selections from the Spaghetti Western film scores of Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film Twisted Nerve is whistled by the menacing Elle Driver in the hospital scene. A brief, 15-second excerpt from the opening of the Ironside theme music by Quincy Jones is used as the Bride's revenge motif, which flares up with a red-tinged flashback whenever she is in the company of her next target. Instrumental tracks from Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei figure prominently, and after the success of Kill Bill they were frequently used in American TV commercials and at sporting events. The end credits are driven by the rock and roll version of \"Malague\u00f1a Salerosa\", a traditional Mexican song, performed by \"Chingon\", Robert Rodriguez's band.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical release\r\nKill Bill: Volume 2 was released in theaters on April 16, 2004. It was originally scheduled to be released on February 20, 2004, but was rescheduled. Variety posited that the delay was to coincide its theatrical release with Volume 1's release on DVD. In the United States and Canada, Volume 2 was released in 2,971 theaters and grossed $25.1 million on its opening weekend, ranking first at the box office and beating fellow opener The Punisher. Volume 2's opening weekend gross was higher than Volume 1's, and the equivalent success confirmed the studio's financial decision to split the film into two theatrical releases.\r\nVolume 2 attracted more female theatergoers than Volume 1, with 60% of the audience being male and 56% of the audience being men between the ages of 18 to 29 years old. Volume 2's opening weekend was the largest to date for Miramax Films aside from releases under its arm Dimension Films. The opening weekend was also the largest to date in the month of April for a film restricted in the United States to theatergoers 17 years old and up, besting Life's 1999 record. Volume 2's opening weekend was strengthened by the reception of Volume 1 in the previous year among audiences and critics, abundant publicity related to the splitting into two volumes, and the DVD release of Volume 1 in the week before Volume 2's theatrical release.\r\nOutside of the United States and Canada, Volume 2 was released in 20 territories over the weekend of April 23, 2004. It grossed an estimated $17.7 million and ranked first at the international box office, ending an eight-week streak held by The Passion of the Christ. Volume 2 grossed a total of $66.2 million in the United States and Canada and $86 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $152.2 million.\r\nHome release\r\nIn the United States, Volume 2 was released on DVD and VHS on August 10, 2004.\r\nIn a December 2005 interview, Tarantino addressed the lack of a special edition DVD for Kill Bill by stating \"I've been holding off because I've been working on it for so long that I just wanted a year off from Kill Bill and then I'll do the big supplementary DVD package.\"\r\nThe United States does not have a DVD boxed set of Kill Bill, though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom. Upon the DVD release of Volume 2 in the US, however, Best Buy did offer an exclusive box set slipcase to house the two individual releases together.\r\nBoth Volume 1 and Volume 2, were released in High Definition on Blu-ray on September 9, 2008 in the United States.\r\nThe Whole Bloody Affair\r\nAt the 2008 Provincetown International Film Festival, Tarantino announced that the original cut of Kill Bill, incorporating both films and an extended animation sequence, would be released in May 2009 as Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair. Screenings began on March 27, 2011 at the New Beverly Cinema.\r\nCritical reception\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Kill Bill: Volume 2 received a score of 84% based on reviews from 238 critics, and an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Kill Bill: Volume 2 adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nRoger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of 4, writing: \"Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. ... This is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it's greater than its two parts.\" In 2009, he named Kill Bill one of the 20 best films of the decade.\r\nAccolades\r\nUma Thurman received a Golden Globe Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama nomination in 2005 for her role. David Carradine also received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in the same year. Kill Bill: Volume 2 was placed in Empire Magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\" at number 423 and the Bride was also ranked number 66 in Empire magazine's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\".\r\nPossible sequels\r\nIn April 2004, Tarantino told Entertainment Weekly that he was planning a sequel:\r\nOh yeah, initially I was thinking this would be my \"Dollars Trilogy\". I was going to do a new one every ten years. But I need at least fifteen years before I do this again. I've already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale will get all of Bill's money. She'll raise Nikki, who'll take on The Bride. Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now so I can get the actresses while they're this age.\r\nAt the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Tarantino stated that, after the completion of Grindhouse, he wanted to make two anime Kill Bill films: an origin story about Bill and his mentors, and another origin starring the Bride. Details emerged around 2007 about two possible sequels, Kill Bill: Volume 3 and Volume 4. According to the article, \"the third film involves the revenge of two killers whose arms and eye were hacked by Uma Thurman in the first stories.\" The article adds that the \"fourth installment of the popular kung fu action films concerns a cycle of reprisals and daughters who avenge their mother's deaths\".\r\nAt the 2009 Morelia International Film Festival, Tarantino stated that he intended to make a third Kill Bill film. The same month, he stated that Kill Bill 3 would be his ninth film, and would be released in 2014. He said he wanted 10 years to pass after the Bride's last conflict, to give her and her daughter a period of peace.\r\nIn December 2012, Tarantino said there would \"probably not\" be a third film.\" However, in July 2019, Tarantino said that he and Thurman had talked again about a possible sequel, and added: If any of my movies were going to spring from my other movies, it would be a third Kill Bill.\" In December, Tarantino said he had spoken to Thurman about an \"interesting\" idea for a new film: \"It would be at least three years from now. It is definitely in the cards\".",

It stars Uma Thurman as the Bride, who continues her campaign of revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) and their leader Bill (David Carradine), who tried to kill her and her unborn child.</p><p>Tarantino conceived Kill Bill as a homage to \"grindhouse\" cinema including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti westerns. Volume 2 is the second of two Kill Bill films produced simultaneously; the first, Volume 1, was released in 2003. The films were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. Like Volume 1, Volume 2 received positive reviews and was a commercial success.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Four years before the events of Kill Bill: Volume 1, the pregnant Bride and her groom rehearse their wedding.

According to the article, \"the third film involves the revenge of two killers whose arms and eye were hacked by Uma Thurman in the first stories.\" The article adds that the \"fourth installment of the popular kung fu action films concerns a cycle of reprisals and daughters who avenge their mother's deaths\".</p><p>At the 2009 Morelia International Film Festival, Tarantino stated that he intended to make a third Kill Bill film. The same month, he stated that Kill Bill 3 would be his ninth film, and would be released in 2014. He said he wanted 10 years to pass after the Bride's last conflict, to give her and her daughter a period of peace.</p><p>In December 2012, Tarantino said there would \"probably not\" be a third film.\" However, in July 2019, Tarantino said that he and Thurman had talked again about a possible sequel, and added: If any of my movies were going to spring from my other movies, it would be a third Kill Bill.\" In December, Tarantino said he had spoken to Thurman about an \"interesting\" idea for a new film: \"It would be at least three years from now. It is definitely in the cards\".</p><br/>"
