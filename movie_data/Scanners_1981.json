Another scanner, Cameron Vale (Lack), is dispatched by ConSec to stop Revok.\r\nPlot\r\nPrivate military company ConSec recruits \"scanners\" \u2013 super-powered individuals capable of telepathy and psychokinesis \u2013 and uses them in service of the company. However, when one of ConSec's scanners demonstrates his powers at a marketing event, the volunteer \u2013 Darryl Revok \u2013 turns out to be a more powerful scanner, who causes the ConSec scanner's head to explode. When ConSec officials attempt to take Revok into custody, he kills them and escapes. Stung by this embarrassing experience, ConSec security head Braedon Keller advocates shutting down ConSec's scanner research program. Program head Dr. Paul Ruth disagrees, saying the assassination and escape demonstrate the potential of scanners. Ruth attributes the operation to Revok, who (according to Ruth) has his own underground network of scanners competing with ConSec's program. Ruth argues that ConSec should use scanners to infiltrate and bring down Revok's group. Dr. Ruth brings in scanner Cameron Vale, a homeless social outcast driven mad by his undisciplined power, and injects him with ephemerol, which temporarily inhibits his scanning ability and restores his sanity. When Vale's mind is clear, Ruth asks for his help, explaining that Vale is a scanner and Revok is killing all scanners who refuse to join him. Under Ruth's guidance, Vale learns to control his scanning abilities.\r\nUnknown to Dr. Ruth, ConSec's security head, Keller, works for Revok as a spy. Revok learns of Ruth's infiltration plan, and dispatches assassins to follow Vale as he visits an unaffiliated scanner named Benjamin Pierce, who may know Revok's whereabouts. Revok's assassins shoot Pierce to death, but Vale reads Pierce's dying brain and learns of a group of scanners in opposition to Revok's group led by Kim Obrist. Vale tracks down Obrist and attends a meeting, but Revok's assassins strike again; only Vale and Obrist survive. Scanning an assassin, Vale learns of a drug company, which he then infiltrates. He finds large quantities of ephemerol are being distributed under a computer program called \"Ripe\", run by Revok himself through ConSec. Vale and Obrist return to ConSec, where Ruth suggests Vale cyberpathically-scan the computer system to learn more about the Ripe program. Meanwhile, Keller attacks Obrist and kills Dr. Ruth while Vale and Obrist flee the ConSec building. Vale cyberpathically accesses the computer network through a telephone booth and pulls ephemerol shipment information. When Keller discovers this, he orders the computer system shut down while Vale is scanning it; Keller hopes to harm or kill Vale by doing so. The plan backfires and the computer explodes, killing Keller and leaving Vale and Obrist unharmed. They visit a doctor on the list of ephemerol recipients, where Obrist discovers a pregnant woman's fetus has scanned her. Vale realizes ephemerol also causes fetuses to become scanners when administered to pregnant women. Obrist and Vale are ambushed by Revok and his men and abducted.\r\nRevok reveals to Vale that ephemerol was originally developed by Dr. Ruth as a sedative for pregnant women: Ruth learned about the drug's side-effect by providing it to his wife during her pregnancies. Revok reveals that he and Vale are actually brothers and Dr. Ruth was their father. Because their mother received the highest dose of ephemerol, Revok and Vale are the most powerful scanners. By mass-distributing ephemerol to unwitting doctors, who prescribe it to their pregnant patients, Revok plans to create a new generation of scanners to take over the world, which he will control. Revok asks Vale to join him, but Vale refuses. The two have a telepathic battle against one another. While Vale's body is incinerated, his mind takes over Revok's body to save himself. Obrist enters the room to find Vale's charred body on the floor. She hears Vale's voice coming from the corner of the room. In the corner is Revok, with his head scar gone and his eyes replaced with Vale's eyes. He faces Obrist and announces in Vale's voice, \"We've won.\"\r\nCast\r\nStephen Lack as Cameron Vale\r\nJennifer O'Neill as Kim Obrist\r\nPatrick McGoohan as Dr. Paul Ruth\r\nLawrence Dane as Braedon Keller\r\nMichael Ironside as Darryl Revok\r\nRobert Silverman as Benjamin Pierce\r\nMavor Moore as Curtis Trevellyan\r\nAnthony Sherwood as Aiden\r\nFred Doederlein as Dieder Tautz\r\nVictor D\u00e9sy as Dr. Gatineau\r\nLouis Del Grande as First Scanner\r\nAlex Stevens as ConSec Programmer\r\nWilliam Hope, Christopher Britton, and Leon Herbert have uncredited appearances as Bicarbon Amalgamate employees. Neil Affleck has a minor role as a medical student.\r\nProduction\r\nWriter and director David Cronenberg has called Scanners one of his most difficult films to make, citing an incomplete script when the shooting schedule commenced, as well as a lack of constructed sets. According to Cronenberg, he would spend mornings prior to filming writing scenes.\r\nThe film was shot primarily on-location in Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario. The lecture scene was filmed at Concordia University, and the Charles J. Des Baillets Water Treatment Plant doubled as the 'Bicarbon Amalgamate' compound. The \"Future Electronique\" building in Vaudreuil-Dorion provided the exterior of 'ConSec' headquarters. The sequence of Revok (Michael Ironside) hijacking a car and causing another to crash were shot on Rue de la Commune. The metro station was Yorkdale station, with additional scenes filmed in the Yorkville neighborhood.\r\nMake-up artist Dick Smith (The Exorcist, Amadeus) provided prosthetics for the climactic scanner duel and the iconic exploding head effect.\r\nHead explosion effect\r\nThe iconic head explosion scene was the product of trial and error, eventually settling on a plaster skull and a gelatin exterior packed with \"latex scraps, some wax, and just bits and bobs and a lot of stringy stuff that we figured would fly through the air a little better\" as well as \"leftover burgers.\" When other explosive techniques failed to give the desired effect, special effects supervisor Gary Zeller told the crew to roll cameras and get inside the trucks with doors and windows closed, and proceeded to lie down behind the dummy and fire a shotgun at the back of the head.\r\nRelease\r\nScanners was released in the United States on January 14, 1981, by Avco Embassy Pictures, and grossed $2,758,147 from 387 theatres in its opening weekend. It grossed a total of $14,225,876 at the box office. A novelization by Leon Whiteson, David Cronenberg's Scanners, was also released in 1981.\r\nReception\r\nCritical reception\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 33 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Scanners is a dark sci-fi story with special effects that'll make your head explode.\" Film professor Charles Derry, in his overview of the horror genre Dark Dreams, cited Scanners as \"an especially important masterwork\" and calling it the Psycho of its day.\r\nSome reviews were less positive. Film critic Roger Ebert gave Scanners two out of four stars and wrote, \"Scanners is so lockstep that we are basically reduced to watching the special effects, which are good but curiously abstract, because we don't much care about the people they're happening around\". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \"Had Mr. Cronenberg settled simply for horror, as John Carpenter did in his classic Halloween (though not in his not-so-classic The Fog), Scanners might have been a Grand Guignol treat. Instead he insists on turning the film into a mystery, and mystery demands eventual explanations that, when they come in Scanners, underline the movie's essential foolishness\". John Simon of the National Review described Scanners as trash.\r\nChristopher John reviewed Scanners in Ares Magazine #8 and commented that \"Scanners is top-notch entertainment. It is haunting, exciting, shocking and literate \u2013 an unusual combination to discover in a film these days.\"\r\nA reassessment of Scanners in the 2012 issue of CineAction looks at the film in light of Cronenberg's use of allegory and parables in much of his work. The argument is made that Cronenberg uses iconic imagery that refers directly and indirectly to the thirty-something Scanners as 1960s political radicals, counterculture hippies, and as nascent Young Urban Professionals. As a result, the film can be seen \"as an oblique reflection on what might happen when the counterculture becomes the dominant culture\".\r\nAwards and honors\r\nAlthough Scanners was not nominated for any major awards, it did receive some recognition. The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films gave the film its Saturn Award in 1981 for \"Best International Film\", and, in addition, the \"Best Make-Up\" award went to Dick Smith in a tie with Altered States. The film had also been nominated for \"Best Special Effects\".\r\nScanners also won \"Best International Fantasy Film\" from Fantasporto in 1983, and was nominated for eight Genie Awards in 1982, but did not win any.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nMondo released the Howard Shore score for Scanners, alongside The Brood, on vinyl; it features cover art by Sam Wolfe Conelly.\r\nLegacy\r\nScanners spawned sequels and a series of spin-offs; a remake was announced in 2007, but as of 2019 had not gone into production. None of these projects has involved Cronenberg as director.\r\nSequels\r\nScanners II: The New Order (1991)\r\nScanners III: The Takeover (1992)\r\nSpin-offs\r\nScanner Cop (1994)\r\nScanners: The Showdown (also known as Scanner Cop II) (1995)\r\nRemake\r\nIn February 2007, Darren Lynn Bousman (director of Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV) was announced as director of a remake of the film, to be released by The Weinstein Company and Dimension Films. David S. Goyer was assigned to script the film. The film was planned for release on October 17, 2008, but the date came and went without further announcements and all of the parties involved have since moved on to other projects.
