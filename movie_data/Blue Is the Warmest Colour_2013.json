She dates men but finds no satisfaction with them sexually, and is rejected by a female friend who she does desire. She dreams of something more. She meets Emma who is a free spirited girl whom Ad\u00e8le's friends reject due to her sexuality, and by association most begin to reject Ad\u00e8le. Her relationship with Emma grows into more than just friends as she is the only person with whom she can express herself openly. Together, Ad\u00e8le and Emma explore social acceptance, sexuality, and the emotional spectrum of their maturing relationship.",

Many critics declared it one of the best films of 2013.\r\nPlot\r\nAd\u00e8le is an introverted 15-year-old high-school student. While crossing the street one day, she passes by a woman with short blue hair and is instantly attracted. She later dates and has sex with a boy from school named Thomas, but she is ultimately dissatisfied and breaks off their relationship. After having vivid fantasies about the woman she saw on the street and having one of her female friends kiss her, she becomes troubled about her sexual identity.\r\nHer best friend, the openly gay Valentin, seems to understand her confusion and takes her to a gay dance bar. After some time, Ad\u00e8le leaves and walks into a lesbian bar, where she experiences assertive advances from some of the women. The blue-haired woman is also there and intervenes, claiming Ad\u00e8le is her cousin to those pursuing Ad\u00e8le. The woman is Emma, a graduating art student. They become friends and begin to spend more time with each other. Ad\u00e8le's friends suspect her of being a lesbian and ostracise her at school. Despite the backlash, she becomes close to Emma. Their bond increases and before long, the two share a kiss at a picnic. They later have sex and begin a passionate relationship. Emma's artsy family is very welcoming to the couple, but Ad\u00e8le tells her conservative, working-class parents that Emma is just a tutor for philosophy class.\r\nIn the years that follow, the two women move in and live with each other. Ad\u00e8le finishes school and joins the teaching staff at a local elementary school, while Emma tries to move forward with her painting career, frequently throwing house parties to socialise with her circle. At one of these, Ad\u00e8le meets some of them: Lise, a pregnant woman and colleague, Joachim, \"the biggest gallery owner in Lille\", and Samir, an aspiring actor who feels out of place amongst the intellectuals, with whom she strikes up a friendship. Emma belittles Ad\u00e8le's teaching career, encouraging her to find fulfilment in writing, while Ad\u00e8le insists that she is happy the way she is. It gradually becomes increasingly apparent how little they have in common, and emotional complexities manifest in the relationship. Out of loneliness and confusion Ad\u00e8le sleeps with Antoine, a male colleague.\r\nEmma becomes aware of the fling and furiously confronts Ad\u00e8le and, refusing her tearful apologies, breaks up with her and throws her out. Time passes and although Ad\u00e8le finds satisfaction in her job as a kindergarten teacher, she still cannot overcome her heartbreak. The two eventually meet again in a restaurant. Ad\u00e8le is still deeply in love with Emma and despite the powerful connection that is clearly still there between them, Emma is now in a committed partnership with Lise, who now has a young daughter. Ad\u00e8le is devastated, but holds it in. Emma admits that she does not feel sexually fulfilled but has accepted it as a part of her new phase in life. She reassures Ad\u00e8le that their relationship was special, and she will always have \"infinite tenderness\" for her. The two part on amicable terms.\r\nLater, Ad\u00e8le goes to Emma's new art exhibition. Hanging on one wall is a nude painting that Emma once did of her during the sensual bloom of their life together. Though Emma acknowledges her, her attention is primarily on the gallery's other guests and Lise. Ad\u00e8le congratulates Emma on the success of her art and leaves quietly after a brief conversation with Samir. He chases after her but heads in the wrong direction, while Ad\u00e8le walks away into the distance.\r\nCast\r\nL\u00e9a Seydoux as Emma\r\nAd\u00e8le Exarchopoulos as Ad\u00e8le\r\nSalim Kechiouche as Samir\r\nAur\u00e9lien Recoing as Ad\u00e8le's father\r\nCatherine Sal\u00e9e as Ad\u00e8le's mother\r\nBenjamin Siksou as Antoine\r\nMona Walravens as Lise\r\nAlma Jodorowsky as B\u00e9atrice\r\nJ\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laheurte as Thomas\r\nAnne Loiret as Emma's mother\r\nBeno\u00eet Pilot as Emma's stepfather\r\nSandor Funtek as Valentin\r\nFanny Maurin as Am\u00e9lie\r\nMaelys Cabezon as Laetitia\r\nSt\u00e9phane Mercoyrol as Joachim\r\nAurelie Lemanceau as Sabine\r\nThemes and interpretations\r\nSexuality\r\nLesbian sexuality is one of the strongest themes of the film, as the narrative deals mainly with Adele's exploration of her identity in this context. However, the film's treatment of lesbian sexuality has been questioned by academics, due to its being directed from a straight, male perspective. In Sight & Sound, film scholar Sophie Mayer suggests that in Blue is the Warmest Colour, \"Like homophobia, the lesbian here melts away. As with many male fantasies of lesbianism, the film centers on the erotic success and effective failures of relations between women\". The issue of perspective has also been addressed in a Film Comment review by Kristin M. Jones, who points out that \"Emma's supposedly sophisticated friends make eager remarks about art and female sexuality that seem to mirror the director's problematic approach toward the representation of women\".\r\nSocial class\r\nOne recurring thematic element addressed by critics and audiences is the division of social class and the exploration of freedom and love between the two central characters, Ad\u00e8le and Emma. The reference to social class is juxtaposed between the two dinner table scenes in the film, with Ad\u00e8le's conservative, working-class family engaging in discussion over comparatively banal subjects to Emma's more open-minded, middle-class family, who focus their discussion primarily on more existential matters: art, career, life and passion. Perhaps one of the most significant differences between Ad\u00e8le's and Emma's families is that Emma's is aware of their lesbian relationship, while Ad\u00e8le's conservative parents are under the impression the women are just friends. Some critics have noted that the difference of social class is an ongoing theme in Kechiche's filmography: \"As in Kechiche's earlier work, social class, and the divisions it creates, are a vital thread; he even changed the first name of the story's passionate protagonist from Cl\u00e9mentine to that of his actress, partly because it means \"justice\" in Arabic. His fascination and familiarity with the world of pedagogy, as shown here in Ad\u00e8le's touching reverence for teaching, is another notable characteristic\", was noted by a Film Comment critic.\r\nFood\r\nKechiche explores how food can evoke varying levels of symbolism, for instance through the sexually suggestive food metaphors of Ad\u00e8le's liking of the fat on ham and her learning to eat oysters from Emma. Additionally, he looks at how food can be seen as an indicator of social class.\r\nProduction\r\nAdaptation\r\nDirector and screenwriter Abdellatif Kechiche developed the premise for Blue Is the Warmest Colour while directing his second feature film, Games of Love and Chance (2003). He met teachers \"who felt very strongly about reading, painting, writing\" and it inspired him to develop a script which charts the personal life and career of a female French teacher. However, the concept was only finalized a few years later when Kechiche chanced upon Julie Maroh's graphic novel, and he saw how he could link his screenplay about a school teacher with Maroh's love story between two young women. Although Maroh's story takes precedence in the adaptation, Ad\u00e8le's character, named \"Cl\u00e9mentine\" in the book, differs from the original as explored by Charles Taylor in The Yale Review: \"The novel includes scenes of the girls being discovered in bed and thrown out of the house and speeches like What's horrible is that people kill each other for oil and commit genocide, not that they give their love to someone.\" In the film, Ad\u00e8le's parents are seemingly oblivious to her love affair with Emma and politely greet her under the impression that she is Ad\u00e8le's philosophy tutor. Further themes are explored in Maroh's novel, such as addiction to prescription pills. Regarding his intention to portray young people, Kechiche claimed: \"I almost wish I was born now, because young people seem to be much more beautiful and brighter than my generation. I want to pay them tribute.\"\r\nCasting\r\nIn late 2011, a casting call was held in Paris to find the ideal actress for the role of Ad\u00e8le. Casting director Sophie Blanvillain first spotted Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and then arranged for her to meet Abdellatif Kechiche. Exarchopoulos described how her auditions with Kechiche over the course of two months consisted of improvisation of scenarios, discussions, and also of them both sitting in a caf\u00e9, without talking, while he quietly observed her. It was later, a day before the New Year, that Kechiche decided to offer Exarchopoulos the leading role in the film; as he said in an interview, \"I chose Ad\u00e8le the minute I saw her. I had taken her for lunch at a brasserie. She ordered lemon tart and when I saw the way she ate it I thought, 'It's her!'\"\r\nOn the other hand, L\u00e9a Seydoux was cast for the role of Emma, ten months before principal photography began in March 2012. Kechiche felt that Seydoux \"shared her character's beauty, voice, intelligence and freedom\" and that she has \"something of an Arabic soul\". He added on saying, \"What was decisive during our meeting was her take on society: She's very much tuned in to the world around her. She possesses a real social awareness, she has a real engagement with the world, very similar to my own. I was able to realise to how great an extent, as I spent a whole year with her between the time she was chosen for the role and the end of shooting.\" Speaking to IndieWire on the preparation for her role, Seydoux said \"During those ten months (before shooting) I was already meeting with him (Kechiche) and being directed. We would spend hours talking about women and life; I also took painting and sculpting lessons, and read a lot about art and philosophy.\"\r\nFilming\r\nThe film, originally planned to be shot in two and a half months, was shot in five months, from March to August 2012 with a budget of \u20ac4 million. Seven hundred and fifty hours of dailies were shot. Shooting took place in Lille as well as Roubaix and Li\u00e9vin.\r\nIn terms of cinematography, the shot reverse shot scenes in the film were simultaneously shot with two different cameras. For Kechiche, this technique not only facilitates editing but also adds beauty to the scene which feels more truthful. Another characteristic aspect of Blue's cinematography is the predominance of close-ups. Cinematographer Sofian El Fani used the Canon EOS C300 camera with Ang\u00e9nieux zoom lenses, and the entire production was undertaken in a digital workflow.\r\nControversies\r\nUpon its premiere at the 2013 Cannes Festival, a report from the French Audiovisual and Cinematographic Union (Syndicat des professionnels de l'industrie de l'audiovisuel et du cin\u00e9ma) criticised the working conditions from which the crew suffered. According to the report, members of the crew said the production occurred in a \"heavy\" atmosphere with behavior close to \"moral harassment,\" which led some members of the crew and workers to quit. Further criticism targeted disrupted working patterns and salaries. Technicians accused director Abdellatif Kechiche of harassment, unpaid overtime, and violations of labor laws.\r\nIn September 2013, the two main actresses, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, also complained about Kechiche's behaviour during the shooting. They described the experience as \"horrible,\" and said they would not work with him again. Exarchopoulos later said about the rift: \"No, it was real, but it was not as big as it looks. For me, a shoot is a human adventure, and in every adventure you have some conflict.\" In an interview in January 2014, Seydoux clarified: \"I'm still very happy with this film. It was hard to film it and maybe people think I was complaining and being spoiled, but that's not it. I just said it was hard. The truth is it was extremely hard but that's OK. I don't mind that it was hard. I like to be tested. Life is much harder. He's a very honest director and I love his cinema. I really like him as a director. The way he treats us? So what!\"\r\nIn September 2013, Kechiche stated that the film should not be released. Speaking to French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, Kechiche said \"I think this film should not go out; it was too sullied\", referring to the negative press about his on-set behaviour.\r\nStyle\r\nThe film portrays Adele and Emma's relationship with an overarching sense of realism. The camerawork, along with many of Kechiche's directorial decisions allow a true-to-life feel for the film, which in turn has led to audiences reading the film with meaning that they can derive from their own personal experiences. In The Yale Review, Charles Taylor puts this into words: \"Instead of fencing its young lovers within a petting zoo... Kechiche removes the barriers that separate us from them. He brings the camera so close to the faces of his actresses that he seems to be trying to make their flesh more familiar to us than his own.\"\r\nSignificance of the colour blue\r\nBlue Is the Warmest Colour is also filled with visual symbolism. The colour blue is used extensively throughout the film\u2014from the lighting in the gay club Ad\u00e8le visits, to the dress she wears in the last scene and most notably, in Emma's hair and eyes. For Ad\u00e8le, blue represents emotional intensity, curiosity, love, and sadness. Ad\u00e8le also references Pablo Picasso a number of times, who famously went through a melancholy Blue Period. As Emma grows out of her relationship with Ad\u00e8le and their passion wanes, she removes the blue from her hair and adopts a more natural, conservative hairstyle.\r\nMusic\r\nReviewer Spencer Wolff noted the political stance adopted by Ad\u00e8le, which changes as her life experiences change and reflect her alternating views: \"Blue is the Warmest Colour is no different; at least, at first. Framed by black and Arab faces, Ad\u00e8le marches in a protest to demand better funding for education. The music, \"On l\u00e2che rien\" (\"We will never give up!\"), by the Algerian-born Kaddour Haddadi, is the official song of the French Communist Party. Yet, soon after she begins her relationship with Emma, we see Ad\u00e8le marching again, hip-to-hip with her new lover, at a gay pride parade.\"\r\nDistribution\r\nRelease\r\nBlue Is the Warmest Colour had its world premiere at the 66th Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2013. It received a standing ovation and ranked highest in critics' polls at the festival. In August 2013, the film had its North American premiere at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival and was also screened in the Special Presentation section of the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on 5 September 2013.\r\nThe film was screened at more than 131 territories and was commercially released on 9 October 2013 in France by Wild Bunch with a \"12\" rating. In the United States, the film was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"explicit sexual content\". It had a limited release at four theatres in New York City and Los Angeles on 25 October 2013, and expanded gradually in subsequent weeks. The film was released on 15 November 2013 in the United Kingdom and in Australia and New Zealand on 13 February 2014.\r\nHome media\r\nLa Vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2 was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in France by Wild Side on 26 February 2014, and in North America, as Blue is the Warmest Color through The Criterion Collection on 25 February 2014. As Blue Is the Warmest Colour, the film was also released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Canada on 25 February 2014 by Mongrel Media, in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2014 by Artificial Eye and on 18 June 2014, in Australia by Transmission Films.\r\nIn Brazil, Blu-ray manufacturing companies Sonopress and Sony DADC are refusing to produce the film because of its content. The distributor is struggling to reverse this situation.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nBlue Is the Warmest Colour grossed a worldwide total of $19,492,879. During its opening in France on 9 October 2013, the film debuted with a weekend total of $2.3 million on 285 screens for a $8,200 per-screen average. It took the fourth spot in its first weekend, which was seen as a \"notably good showing because of its nearly three-hour length\".\r\nThe film had a limited release in the U.S. and it grossed an estimated $101,116 in its first weekend ending 25 October 2013, with an average of $25,279 for four theatres in New York City and Los Angeles. The film grossed $2,199,787 at US theatrically. The film went on to achieve greater success in the U.S. home entertainment market, generating more than $3,500,000 in US Blu-ray/DVD sales alone.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 191 reviews with a weighted average of 8.15/10. The site's critical consensus is: \"Raw, honest, powerfully acted, and deliciously intense, Blue Is the Warmest Colour offers some of modern cinema's most elegantly composed, emotionally absorbing drama.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 88 averaged from 51 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nMore than 40 critics named the film as one of the ten best of 2013. In 2016, the film was named as the 45th best film of the 21st century, from a poll of 177 film critics from around the world. In France Les Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma placed the film third in their 2013 Top Ten chart.\r\nIn The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin awarded the film a maximum of five stars and tipped it to win the Palme d'Or. He wrote: \"Kechiche's film is three hours long, and the only problem with that running time is that I could have happily watched it for another seven. It is an extraordinary, prolonged popping-candy explosion of pleasure, sadness, anger, lust and hope, and contained within it \u2013 although only just \u2013 are the two best performances of the festival, from Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux.\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw added that \"it is genuinely passionate film-making\" and changed his star rating for the film to five out of five stars after previously having awarded it only four. Stephen Garrett of The New York Observer said that the film was \"nothing less than a triumph\" and \"is a major work of sexual awakening\".\r\nAndrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, \"Not unlike Wong Kar-wai's most matured effort in cinema, Happy Together, director Abdellatif Kechiche knows love and relationship well and the details he goes about everything is almost breathtaking to endure. There is a scene in the restaurant where two meet again, after years of separation, the tears that dwell on their eyes shows precisely how much they love each other, yet there is no way they will be together again. Blue Is the Warmest Colour is likely to be 2013's most powerful film and easily one of the best.\"\r\nConcerns about graphic sex\r\nAt Cannes, the film shocked some critics with its long and graphic sex scenes (although fake genitalia were used), leading them to state that the film may require some editing before it is screened in cinemas. Several critics placed the film as the front-runner to win the Palme d'Or. The judging panel, which included Steven Spielberg, Ang Lee, and Nicole Kidman, made an unprecedented move to award the Palme d'Or to the film's two main actresses along with the director. Jury President Steven Spielberg explained:\r\nThe film is a great love story that made all of us feel privileged to be a fly on the wall, to see this story of deep love and deep heartbreak evolve from the beginning. The director did not put any constraints on the narrative and we were absolutely spellbound by the amazing performances of the two actresses, and especially the way the director observed his characters and just let the characters breathe.\r\nJustin Chang, writing for Variety, said that the film contains \"the most explosively graphic lesbian sex scenes in recent memory\". Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter said that despite being three hours long, the film \"is held together by phenomenal turns from L\u00e9a Seydoux and newcomer Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, in what is clearly a breakout performance\".\r\nWriting in The Australian, David Stratton said, \"If the film were just a series of sex scenes it would, of course, be problematic, but it's much, much more than that. Through the eyes of Ad\u00e8le we experience the breathless excitement of first love and first physical contact, but then, inevitably, all the other experiences that make life the way it is ... All of these are beautifully documented\".\r\nManohla Dargis of The New York Times described the film as \"wildly undisciplined\" and overlong, and wrote that it \"feels far more about Mr. Kechiche's desires than anything else\".\r\nConversely, Richard Brody, writing in The New Yorker about \"Sex Scenes That Are Too Good\", stated: \"The problem with Kechiche's scenes is that they're too good\u2014too unusual, too challenging, too original\u2014to be assimilated ... to the familiar moviegoing experience. Their duration alone is exceptional, as is their emphasis on the physical struggle, the passionate and uninhibited athleticism of sex, the profound marking of the characters' souls by their sexual relationship.\"\r\nLGBT and feminist response\r\nThe film received LGBT and feminist critical comment for the perceived dominance of the male gaze and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a \"patriarchal gaze.\" After a test screening of selected scenes for a lesbian audience, one viewer commented that it was \"hot at the beginning, and then it got ridiculous when they kept switching sex positions every ten seconds\" and that it was like an infomercial designed to address all of the sexual acts that lesbians can engage in. The depiction of scissoring was also debated.\r\nJulie Maroh, the author of the graphic novel upon which the film was based, said, \"It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians.\" Although Maroh praised Kechiche's originality, describing his adaptation as \"coherent, justified and fluid ... a masterstroke\", she also felt that he failed to capture the lesbian heart of her story, and disapproved of the sex scenes. In a blog post, she called the scenes, \"a brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold, of so-called lesbian sex, which turned into porn, and made me feel very ill at ease\", saying that in the movie theatre, \"the hetero-normative laughed because they don't understand it and find the scene ridiculous. The gay and queer people laughed because it's not convincing, and found it ridiculous. And among the only people we didn't hear giggling were the potential guys too busy feasting their eyes on an incarnation of their fantasies on screen\". She added that \"as a feminist and lesbian spectator, I cannot endorse the direction Kechiche took on these matters. But I'm also looking forward to hearing what other women will think about it. This is simply my personal stance.\"\r\nAccolades\r\nThe film won the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The actresses were also given the Palme as a special prize. Kechiche dedicated the award to \"the youth of France\" and the Tunisian Revolution, where \"they have the aspiration to be free, to express themselves and love in full freedom\". At Cannes it also won the FIPRESCI Prize. In addition, this was also the first film adapted from either a graphic novel or a comic to win the Palme d'Or. In December 2013, it received the Louis Delluc Prize for best French film. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 71st Golden Globe Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. At the 39th C\u00e9sar Awards, the film received eight nominations with Exarchopoulos winning the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress.",
            "html": "<h2>Blue Is the Warmest Colour</h2><p>Blue Is the Warmest Colour (French: La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2; French pronunciation: \u200b) is a 2013 French romance film co-written, co-produced, and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, and starring L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos. The film follows Ad\u00e8le (Exarchopoulos), a French teenager who discovers desire and freedom as an aspiring female painter Emma (Seydoux) enters her life. The film charts their relationship from Ad\u00e8le's high school years to her early adult life and career as a school teacher. The premise of Blue Is the Warmest Colour is based on the 2010 graphic novel of the same name by Julie Maroh.</p><p>Production began in March 2012 and lasted six months. Approximately 800 hours of footage was shot, including extensive B-roll footage, with Kechiche ultimately trimming the final cut of the film down to 179 minutes. The film generated controversy upon its premiere at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and before its release. Much of the controversy was about claims of poor working conditions on set by the crew and the lead actresses, and also the film's raw depiction of sexuality.</p><p>At the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, the film unanimously won the Palme d'Or from the official jury and the FIPRESCI Prize. It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with Seydoux and Exarchopoulos joining Jane Campion (The Piano) as the only women to have won the award. The film had its North American premiere at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Many critics declared it one of the best films of 2013.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Ad\u00e8le is an introverted 15-year-old high-school student. While crossing the street one day, she passes by a woman with short blue hair and is instantly attracted. She later dates and has sex with a boy from school named Thomas, but she is ultimately dissatisfied and breaks off their relationship. After having vivid fantasies about the woman she saw on the street and having one of her female friends kiss her, she becomes troubled about her sexual identity.</p><p>Her best friend, the openly gay Valentin, seems to understand her confusion and takes her to a gay dance bar. After some time, Ad\u00e8le leaves and walks into a lesbian bar, where she experiences assertive advances from some of the women. The blue-haired woman is also there and intervenes, claiming Ad\u00e8le is her cousin to those pursuing Ad\u00e8le. The woman is Emma, a graduating art student. They become friends and begin to spend more time with each other. Ad\u00e8le's friends suspect her of being a lesbian and ostracise her at school. Despite the backlash, she becomes close to Emma. Their bond increases and before long, the two share a kiss at a picnic. They later have sex and begin a passionate relationship. Emma's artsy family is very welcoming to the couple, but Ad\u00e8le tells her conservative, working-class parents that Emma is just a tutor for philosophy class.</p><p>In the years that follow, the two women move in and live with each other. Ad\u00e8le finishes school and joins the teaching staff at a local elementary school, while Emma tries to move forward with her painting career, frequently throwing house parties to socialise with her circle. At one of these, Ad\u00e8le meets some of them: Lise, a pregnant woman and colleague, Joachim, \"the biggest gallery owner in Lille\", and Samir, an aspiring actor who feels out of place amongst the intellectuals, with whom she strikes up a friendship. Emma belittles Ad\u00e8le's teaching career, encouraging her to find fulfilment in writing, while Ad\u00e8le insists that she is happy the way she is. It gradually becomes increasingly apparent how little they have in common, and emotional complexities manifest in the relationship. Out of loneliness and confusion Ad\u00e8le sleeps with Antoine, a male colleague.</p><p>Emma becomes aware of the fling and furiously confronts Ad\u00e8le and, refusing her tearful apologies, breaks up with her and throws her out. Time passes and although Ad\u00e8le finds satisfaction in her job as a kindergarten teacher, she still cannot overcome her heartbreak. The two eventually meet again in a restaurant. Ad\u00e8le is still deeply in love with Emma and despite the powerful connection that is clearly still there between them, Emma is now in a committed partnership with Lise, who now has a young daughter. Ad\u00e8le is devastated, but holds it in. Emma admits that she does not feel sexually fulfilled but has accepted it as a part of her new phase in life. She reassures Ad\u00e8le that their relationship was special, and she will always have \"infinite tenderness\" for her. The two part on amicable terms.</p><p>Later, Ad\u00e8le goes to Emma's new art exhibition. Hanging on one wall is a nude painting that Emma once did of her during the sensual bloom of their life together. Though Emma acknowledges her, her attention is primarily on the gallery's other guests and Lise. Ad\u00e8le congratulates Emma on the success of her art and leaves quietly after a brief conversation with Samir. He chases after her but heads in the wrong direction, while Ad\u00e8le walks away into the distance.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>L\u00e9a Seydoux as Emma</li><li>Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos as Ad\u00e8le</li><li>Salim Kechiouche as Samir</li><li>Aur\u00e9lien Recoing as Ad\u00e8le's father</li><li>Catherine Sal\u00e9e as Ad\u00e8le's mother</li><li>Benjamin Siksou as Antoine</li><li>Mona Walravens as Lise</li><li>Alma Jodorowsky as B\u00e9atrice</li><li>J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laheurte as Thomas</li><li>Anne Loiret as Emma's mother</li><li>Beno\u00eet Pilot as Emma's stepfather</li><li>Sandor Funtek as Valentin</li><li>Fanny Maurin as Am\u00e9lie</li><li>Maelys Cabezon as Laetitia</li><li>St\u00e9phane Mercoyrol as Joachim</li><li>Aurelie Lemanceau as Sabine</li></ul><br/><h3>Themes and interpretations</h3><h4>Sexuality</h4><p>Lesbian sexuality is one of the strongest themes of the film, as the narrative deals mainly with Adele's exploration of her identity in this context. However, the film's treatment of lesbian sexuality has been questioned by academics, due to its being directed from a straight, male perspective. In Sight & Sound, film scholar Sophie Mayer suggests that in Blue is the Warmest Colour, \"Like homophobia, the lesbian here melts away. As with many male fantasies of lesbianism, the film centers on the erotic success and effective failures of relations between women\". The issue of perspective has also been addressed in a Film Comment review by Kristin M. Jones, who points out that \"Emma's supposedly sophisticated friends make eager remarks about art and female sexuality that seem to mirror the director's problematic approach toward the representation of women\".</p><h4>Social class</h4><p>One recurring thematic element addressed by critics and audiences is the division of social class and the exploration of freedom and love between the two central characters, Ad\u00e8le and Emma. The reference to social class is juxtaposed between the two dinner table scenes in the film, with Ad\u00e8le's conservative, working-class family engaging in discussion over comparatively banal subjects to Emma's more open-minded, middle-class family, who focus their discussion primarily on more existential matters: art, career, life and passion. Perhaps one of the most significant differences between Ad\u00e8le's and Emma's families is that Emma's is aware of their lesbian relationship, while Ad\u00e8le's conservative parents are under the impression the women are just friends. Some critics have noted that the difference of social class is an ongoing theme in Kechiche's filmography: \"As in Kechiche's earlier work, social class, and the divisions it creates, are a vital thread; he even changed the first name of the story's passionate protagonist from Cl\u00e9mentine to that of his actress, partly because it means \"justice\" in Arabic. His fascination and familiarity with the world of pedagogy, as shown here in Ad\u00e8le's touching reverence for teaching, is another notable characteristic\", was noted by a Film Comment critic.</p><h4>Food</h4><p>Kechiche explores how food can evoke varying levels of symbolism, for instance through the sexually suggestive food metaphors of Ad\u00e8le's liking of the fat on ham and her learning to eat oysters from Emma. Additionally, he looks at how food can be seen as an indicator of social class.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Adaptation</h4><p>Director and screenwriter Abdellatif Kechiche developed the premise for Blue Is the Warmest Colour while directing his second feature film, Games of Love and Chance (2003). He met teachers \"who felt very strongly about reading, painting, writing\" and it inspired him to develop a script which charts the personal life and career of a female French teacher. However, the concept was only finalized a few years later when Kechiche chanced upon Julie Maroh's graphic novel, and he saw how he could link his screenplay about a school teacher with Maroh's love story between two young women. Although Maroh's story takes precedence in the adaptation, Ad\u00e8le's character, named \"Cl\u00e9mentine\" in the book, differs from the original as explored by Charles Taylor in The Yale Review: \"The novel includes scenes of the girls being discovered in bed and thrown out of the house and speeches like What's horrible is that people kill each other for oil and commit genocide, not that they give their love to someone.\" In the film, Ad\u00e8le's parents are seemingly oblivious to her love affair with Emma and politely greet her under the impression that she is Ad\u00e8le's philosophy tutor. Further themes are explored in Maroh's novel, such as addiction to prescription pills. Regarding his intention to portray young people, Kechiche claimed: \"I almost wish I was born now, because young people seem to be much more beautiful and brighter than my generation. I want to pay them tribute.\"</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>In late 2011, a casting call was held in Paris to find the ideal actress for the role of Ad\u00e8le. Casting director Sophie Blanvillain first spotted Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and then arranged for her to meet Abdellatif Kechiche. Exarchopoulos described how her auditions with Kechiche over the course of two months consisted of improvisation of scenarios, discussions, and also of them both sitting in a caf\u00e9, without talking, while he quietly observed her. It was later, a day before the New Year, that Kechiche decided to offer Exarchopoulos the leading role in the film; as he said in an interview, \"I chose Ad\u00e8le the minute I saw her. I had taken her for lunch at a brasserie. She ordered lemon tart and when I saw the way she ate it I thought, 'It's her!'\"</p><p>On the other hand, L\u00e9a Seydoux was cast for the role of Emma, ten months before principal photography began in March 2012. Kechiche felt that Seydoux \"shared her character's beauty, voice, intelligence and freedom\" and that she has \"something of an Arabic soul\". He added on saying, \"What was decisive during our meeting was her take on society: She's very much tuned in to the world around her. She possesses a real social awareness, she has a real engagement with the world, very similar to my own. I was able to realise to how great an extent, as I spent a whole year with her between the time she was chosen for the role and the end of shooting.\" Speaking to IndieWire on the preparation for her role, Seydoux said \"During those ten months (before shooting) I was already meeting with him (Kechiche) and being directed. We would spend hours talking about women and life; I also took painting and sculpting lessons, and read a lot about art and philosophy.\"</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>The film, originally planned to be shot in two and a half months, was shot in five months, from March to August 2012 with a budget of \u20ac4 million. Seven hundred and fifty hours of dailies were shot. Shooting took place in Lille as well as Roubaix and Li\u00e9vin.</p><p>In terms of cinematography, the shot reverse shot scenes in the film were simultaneously shot with two different cameras. For Kechiche, this technique not only facilitates editing but also adds beauty to the scene which feels more truthful. Another characteristic aspect of Blue's cinematography is the predominance of close-ups. Cinematographer Sofian El Fani used the Canon EOS C300 camera with Ang\u00e9nieux zoom lenses, and the entire production was undertaken in a digital workflow.</p><h4>Controversies</h4><p>Upon its premiere at the 2013 Cannes Festival, a report from the French Audiovisual and Cinematographic Union (Syndicat des professionnels de l'industrie de l'audiovisuel et du cin\u00e9ma) criticised the working conditions from which the crew suffered. According to the report, members of the crew said the production occurred in a \"heavy\" atmosphere with behavior close to \"moral harassment,\" which led some members of the crew and workers to quit. Further criticism targeted disrupted working patterns and salaries. Technicians accused director Abdellatif Kechiche of harassment, unpaid overtime, and violations of labor laws.</p><p>In September 2013, the two main actresses, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, also complained about Kechiche's behaviour during the shooting. They described the experience as \"horrible,\" and said they would not work with him again. Exarchopoulos later said about the rift: \"No, it was real, but it was not as big as it looks. For me, a shoot is a human adventure, and in every adventure you have some conflict.\" In an interview in January 2014, Seydoux clarified: \"I'm still very happy with this film. It was hard to film it and maybe people think I was complaining and being spoiled, but that's not it. I just said it was hard. The truth is it was extremely hard but that's OK. I don't mind that it was hard. I like to be tested. Life is much harder. He's a very honest director and I love his cinema. I really like him as a director. The way he treats us? So what!\"</p><p>In September 2013, Kechiche stated that the film should not be released. Speaking to French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, Kechiche said \"I think this film should not go out; it was too sullied\", referring to the negative press about his on-set behaviour.</p><br/><h3>Style</h3><p>The film portrays Adele and Emma's relationship with an overarching sense of realism. The camerawork, along with many of Kechiche's directorial decisions allow a true-to-life feel for the film, which in turn has led to audiences reading the film with meaning that they can derive from their own personal experiences. In The Yale Review, Charles Taylor puts this into words: \"Instead of fencing its young lovers within a petting zoo... Kechiche removes the barriers that separate us from them. He brings the camera so close to the faces of his actresses that he seems to be trying to make their flesh more familiar to us than his own.\"</p><h4>Significance of the colour blue</h4><p>Blue Is the Warmest Colour is also filled with visual symbolism.

It took the fourth spot in its first weekend, which was seen as a \"notably good showing because of its nearly three-hour length\".</p><p>The film had a limited release in the U.S. and it grossed an estimated $101,116 in its first weekend ending 25 October 2013, with an average of $25,279 for four theatres in New York City and Los Angeles. The film grossed $2,199,787 at US theatrically. The film went on to achieve greater success in the U.S. home entertainment market, generating more than $3,500,000 in US Blu-ray/DVD sales alone.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 191 reviews with a weighted average of 8.15/10. The site's critical consensus is: \"Raw, honest, powerfully acted, and deliciously intense, Blue Is the Warmest Colour offers some of modern cinema's most elegantly composed, emotionally absorbing drama.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 88 averaged from 51 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>More than 40 critics named the film as one of the ten best of 2013. In 2016, the film was named as the 45th best film of the 21st century, from a poll of 177 film critics from around the world. In France Les Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma placed the film third in their 2013 Top Ten chart.</p><p>In The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin awarded the film a maximum of five stars and tipped it to win the Palme d'Or. He wrote: \"Kechiche's film is three hours long, and the only problem with that running time is that I could have happily watched it for another seven. It is an extraordinary, prolonged popping-candy explosion of pleasure, sadness, anger, lust and hope, and contained within it \u2013 although only just \u2013 are the two best performances of the festival, from Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux.\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw added that \"it is genuinely passionate film-making\" and changed his star rating for the film to five out of five stars after previously having awarded it only four. Stephen Garrett of The New York Observer said that the film was \"nothing less than a triumph\" and \"is a major work of sexual awakening\".</p><p>Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, \"Not unlike Wong Kar-wai's most matured effort in cinema, Happy Together, director Abdellatif Kechiche knows love and relationship well and the details he goes about everything is almost breathtaking to endure. There is a scene in the restaurant where two meet again, after years of separation, the tears that dwell on their eyes shows precisely how much they love each other, yet there is no way they will be together again. Blue Is the Warmest Colour is likely to be 2013's most powerful film and easily one of the best.\"</p><h4>Concerns about graphic sex</h4><p>At Cannes, the film shocked some critics with its long and graphic sex scenes (although fake genitalia were used), leading them to state that the film may require some editing before it is screened in cinemas. Several critics placed the film as the front-runner to win the Palme d'Or. The judging panel, which included Steven Spielberg, Ang Lee, and Nicole Kidman, made an unprecedented move to award the Palme d'Or to the film's two main actresses along with the director. Jury President Steven Spielberg explained:</p><blockquote>The film is a great love story that made all of us feel privileged to be a fly on the wall, to see this story of deep love and deep heartbreak evolve from the beginning. The director did not put any constraints on the narrative and we were absolutely spellbound by the amazing performances of the two actresses, and especially the way the director observed his characters and just let the characters breathe.</blockquote><p>Justin Chang, writing for Variety, said that the film contains \"the most explosively graphic lesbian sex scenes in recent memory\". Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter said that despite being three hours long, the film \"is held together by phenomenal turns from L\u00e9a Seydoux and newcomer Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, in what is clearly a breakout performance\".</p><p>Writing in The Australian, David Stratton said, \"If the film were just a series of sex scenes it would, of course, be problematic, but it's much, much more than that. Through the eyes of Ad\u00e8le we experience the breathless excitement of first love and first physical contact, but then, inevitably, all the other experiences that make life the way it is ... All of these are beautifully documented\".</p><p>Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described the film as \"wildly undisciplined\" and overlong, and wrote that it \"feels far more about Mr. Kechiche's desires than anything else\".</p><p>Conversely, Richard Brody, writing in The New Yorker about \"Sex Scenes That Are Too Good\", stated: \"The problem with Kechiche's scenes is that they're too good\u2014too unusual, too challenging, too original\u2014to be assimilated ... to the familiar moviegoing experience. Their duration alone is exceptional, as is their emphasis on the physical struggle, the passionate and uninhibited athleticism of sex, the profound marking of the characters' souls by their sexual relationship.\"</p><h4>LGBT and feminist response</h4><p>The film received LGBT and feminist critical comment for the perceived dominance of the male gaze and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a \"patriarchal gaze.\" After a test screening of selected scenes for a lesbian audience, one viewer commented that it was \"hot at the beginning, and then it got ridiculous when they kept switching sex positions every ten seconds\" and that it was like an infomercial designed to address all of the sexual acts that lesbians can engage in. The depiction of scissoring was also debated.</p><p>Julie Maroh, the author of the graphic novel upon which the film was based, said, \"It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians.\" Although Maroh praised Kechiche's originality, describing his adaptation as \"coherent, justified and fluid ... a masterstroke\", she also felt that he failed to capture the lesbian heart of her story, and disapproved of the sex scenes. In a blog post, she called the scenes, \"a brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold, of so-called lesbian sex, which turned into porn, and made me feel very ill at ease\", saying that in the movie theatre, \"the hetero-normative laughed because they don't understand it and find the scene ridiculous. The gay and queer people laughed because it's not convincing, and found it ridiculous. And among the only people we didn't hear giggling were the potential guys too busy feasting their eyes on an incarnation of their fantasies on screen\". She added that \"as a feminist and lesbian spectator, I cannot endorse the direction Kechiche took on these matters. But I'm also looking forward to hearing what other women will think about it. This is simply my personal stance.\"</p><br/><h3>Accolades</h3><p>The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The actresses were also given the Palme as a special prize. Kechiche dedicated the award to \"the youth of France\" and the Tunisian Revolution, where \"they have the aspiration to be free, to express themselves and love in full freedom\". At Cannes it also won the FIPRESCI Prize. In addition, this was also the first film adapted from either a graphic novel or a comic to win the Palme d'Or. In December 2013, it received the Louis Delluc Prize for best French film. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 71st Golden Globe Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. At the 39th C\u00e9sar Awards, the film received eight nominations with Exarchopoulos winning the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress.</p><br/>"
