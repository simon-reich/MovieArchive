It received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Kolker's performance.\r\nPlot\r\nSeven-year-old Chloe Lewis has spent her entire life living inside of an abandoned house with her father Henry, who forbids her from leaving under the threat of being killed by \"the bad men\". In spite of her father's warnings, Chloe longs to experience the world outside her home and desires a maternal figure in her life due to never meeting her deceased mother Mary. To help Chloe have a normal life, Henry seeks to educate her on general social behavior so she will be able to live as a member of the neighboring Reed family. Chloe observes strange occurrences while in the house, such as Henry expelling blood from his eyes and an apparent female ghost in her closet. Over time, she learns about abnormals, individuals with superhuman abilities who are hunted by the government and contained in the underground facility Madoc Mountain.\r\nWhen Chloe manages to leave her home, she discovers her own abnormal power of telepathy at the prodding of an elderly ice cream truck driver. The ice cream truck driver reveals himself as Chloe's maternal grandfather Alan, who believes his daughter is still alive, and Chloe realizes that the \"ghost\" in her closet is actually Mary being held captive at Madoc Mountain. Henry and Alan are also revealed as abnormals, identified by their bleeding eyes, with Henry using his time-altering powers to cause only a few months to pass outside of his home during his seven years with Chloe. Upon discovering that Chloe left the house and has been in contact with Alan, Henry brings her to the Reeds, but they are turned away when Chloe uses her abilities on the Reed matriarch Nancy. Nancy subsequently contacts the Abnormal Defense Force (ADF) to deal with Chloe and her family, but Chloe tricks the ADF agents into believing that the Reeds are abnormals and they kill Nancy.\r\nThrough telepathy, Chloe begins to help Mary escape from Madoc Mountain, which is hindered by the arrival of ADF Agent Cecelia Ray at the house. When Henry and Alan attempt to deal with her, the agent reveals to Henry that she knows the truth about him and his daughter and a drone strike will be ordered on the house if they kill her. Ray offers to place Chloe under governmental care, but upon realizing Henry and Alan are stalling her, a scuffle ensues that leads to Ray killing Alan and mortally wounding Henry before being killed by Chloe. Henry manages to delay the ADF agents long enough for Chloe to ensure Mary's escape, then slows down time to carry his daughter out of the house before it is destroyed by the drone missile.\r\nAfter Henry succumbs to his injuries, Mary arrives using her flight abilities and kills the remaining ADF agents. Mary promises to keep Chloe hidden at a new location, but Chloe refuses to continue hiding, believing that no one can stop them from living wherever they want. Touched by her daughter's confidence, Mary agrees and flies off with Chloe.\r\nCast\r\nEmile Hirsch as Henry Lewis, Chloe's father who can slow down and stop time\r\nBruce Dern as Alan / Mr. Snowcone, Chloe's maternal grandfather who can turn invisible\r\nGrace Park as Cecelia Ray, a government agent with the Abnormal Defense Force (ADF)\r\nAmanda Crew as Mary Lewis, Chloe's mother who possesses the ability to fly\r\nLexy Kolker as Chloe Lewis, a seven-year-old telepath\r\nAva Telek as Harper Reed, Nancy and Steven's daughter\r\nMichelle Harrison as Nancy Reed, Harper's mother and Steven's wife\r\nMatty Finochio as Steven Reed, Harper's father and Nancy's husband\r\nAleks Paunovic as Robert Kraigen, a guard at Madoc Mountain\r\nAdditionally, R. J. Fetherstonhaugh portrays a police officer who encounters Chloe and Alan at a park. Dakota Daulby appears as the Madoc Mountain executioner and Dean Redman plays an ADF captain.\r\nRelease\r\nFreaks premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018. Two days later, Well Go USA Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film.\r\nAfter Toronto, the film screened at over 40 film festivals around the world, including the Sitges Film Festival in Spain, the Santa Barbara Film Festival, the Cinequest Film Festival, Cleveland Film Festival, and the Vancouver International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Emerging Director award. The Vancouver festival programmers wrote \"Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein's skewed sci-fi thriller ratchets up the go-for-broke audacity as it laces the family drama of Room with genre confections indebted to vintage Spielberg.\"\r\nFreaks won the Asteroide Award, the top prize at the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy, and the Audience Award at Utopiales in France. It won Best Film and the Audience Award at the Paris International Fantastic Film Festival and won the Silver Raven Jury Prize at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival.\r\nFreaks was released in theaters in the U.S. and Canada on September 13, 2019. It was released for online sales and VOD on December 3, 2019, with a Blu-ray and DVD release on December 10, 2019.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nFreaks grossed $276,591 in the United States and Canada, and $61,985 in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $338,576.\r\nCritical response\r\nRotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 87% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10.
