Reception from western critics was much more positive; many critics and film scholars have come to proclaim its action scenes as among the best ever filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled Stranglehold was released, which is in the process of being made into a film.\r\nPlot\r\nIn a teahouse in Hong Kong, Royal Hong Kong Police inspectors \"Tequila\" Yuen and Benny Mak attempt to arrest a group of gun smugglers while they are making a deal. After an ambush from a rival gang member, a fierce gun battle breaks out. The gangsters are defeated but several police officers are badly wounded and Benny is killed. As revenge, Tequila executes the gangster who killed Benny rather than arrest him, much to the chagrin of his superintendent Pang, who needed the gangster alive to testify. Tequila is ordered off the case for his misdemeanor.\r\nElsewhere, Alan, an assassin under the employ of Triad boss \"Uncle\" Hoi, murders one of his subordinates who had double-crossed their clan for a rival syndicate led by upstart Johnny Wong. Wong, who is looking to usurp the old Triad bosses through his control of the illicit arms trade, is impressed by Alan's skill and attempts to recruit him. Alan reluctantly accepts the offer. Wong brings Alan on a raid on Hoi's warehouse, where many of Hoi's men are killed. Hoi is outnumbered; he asks Alan to kill him but spare his men. Alan does so and shoots Hoi's men as well. Tequila then attacks all of Wong's men. During the chaos, Alan spares Tequila's life.\r\nPang confirms to Tequila that Alan is an undercover cop. Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat to try to make sense of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang. Tequila and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, which allows Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes that one of his lieutenants, Foxy, is a police informant. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket earlier to prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is hidden in a vault beneath a nearby hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of the vault. While the two are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.\r\nAlan and Tequila discover a hidden passage in the hospital leading to Wong's vault. There, Mad Dog confronts them in a shootout. The police and gangsters arrive at the hospital. Wong has the patients and staff taken hostage. Over the night, many gangsters and police are shot by each other. Mad Dog requests the hostages be released, but Wong refuses. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients. Pang evacuates the lobby while officer Teresa Chang goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and Tequila continue shooting gangsters, leading to Alan accidentally killing a cop. The duo eventually engage Mad Dog. While Tequila leaves to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with nurses and patients caught in the middle. They offer the group safe passage, but Wong shoots the group in a bid to kill Alan. For that, Mad Dog turns on Wong, but runs out of bullets. Wong kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.\r\nTequila shoots gangsters while protecting the last baby in the hospital. Alan and Tequila are confronted by Wong, who sets off bombs to blow up the building. Alan refuses to escape, choosing to pursue Wong. Tequila jumps out of the hospital while holding wire cables, saving the baby while the hospital explodes. Wong drags Alan outside at gunpoint as a hostage. Wong has Tequila humiliate himself. Alan grabs Wong's pistol and shoots himself through the stomach, giving Tequila the chance to shoot Wong dead.\r\nTo protect Alan from the triads, Pang and Tequila destroy Alan's personnel file and declare him dead, allowing him to leave Hong Kong to find a new life.\r\nCast\r\nChow Yun-fat as Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen Ho-yan: A clarinet-playing police officer whose partner is killed in a restaurant gunfight with a small army of gangsters. Chow had previously worked with director John Woo on several of his films, including A Better Tomorrow, The Killer and Once a Thief.\r\nTony Leung Chiu-Wai as Alan: An undercover cop posing as a high-ranking triad assassin. He makes an origami crane every time he kills someone, a trait which was influenced by Woo's daughter when he saw her making them. Tony's character is shown as living alone and detached from others. Woo stated that this was influenced by Alain Delon's character in the French crime film Le Samoura\u00ef. Leung had previously worked with Woo on his film Bullet in the Head.\r\nTeresa Mo as Teresa Chang: A fellow police officer who is the girlfriend of Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen. Chang helps decode the secret code songs that are sent to the police office by Alan.\r\nPhilip Chan as Supt. Pang: Prior to the film, Philip Chan was a police officer for about fifteen years. Philip Chan felt that certain scenes in the film were very familiar as they were similar to things had to do with real police work.\r\nPhilip Kwok as Mad Dog: A skilled gunfighter working for Johnny Wong.\r\nAnthony Wong as Johnny Wong: Wong is the head of a triad who encourages Alan to kill Uncle Hoi. Wong's triad has a large number of guns hidden in the basement of a hospital.\r\nBowie Lam as Benny: An undercover officer who is killed in the tea house shoot-out.\r\nAnjo Leung as Benny's son.\r\nBobby Au-Yeung as Lionheart: An assistant to Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen.\r\nKwan Hoi-Shan as Mr. Hoi: A triad boss who is the head of the gang Alan is investigating. Mr. Hoi is killed in a warehouse shoot-out.\r\nTung Wei as Foxy: An undercover cop beaten up by Mad Dog. Foxy is spared by Alan, and lives to deliver information to Tequila from Alan. Foxy is later killed by Mad Dog at the hospital in which the final shoot-out takes place.\r\nJohn Woo as a bartender: A bartender at the jazz club who gives advice to Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nThe film was originally developed in 1990. After creating films which focused on the lives of gangsters, director John Woo wanted to make a film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.\r\nBefore production started, Woo told his actors that he was not going to make the film as stylish as his previous films, but to have it be more of an \"edgy thriller\". The role of Teresa Chang was originally made for actress Michelle Yeoh, who had a long relationship with producer Terence Chang. After casting Teresa Mo, the character of Teresa Chang was greatly re-written. The film's initial story was about Tony Leung's character being a psychopath who would poison baby food. When Terence Chang was making connections to have Woo make films in the United States, Chang found people uninterested and disgusted with the theme of babies being poisoned. This halted production for a month to develop a new story. Screenwriter Barry Wong was brought in to write a new story about Tony Leung's character being an undercover police officer. After writing the first part of the script, Wong went on a vacation outside Hong Kong, where he died leaving the script unfinished.\r\nFilming\r\nHard Boiled took 123 days to shoot. Although Woo told his cast that the film would be more gritty and not as stylish as his previous films, Hard Boiled became more stylish as the filming began. The tea house sequence in the film was shot before the script was written. The crew found that the tea house was going to be torn down and decided to film a scene there. Woo saw the staircase in the tea house, and thought about a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while sliding down the banister. The tea house sequence was shot in around a week's time and was choreographed by Woo and Philip Kwok. It was shot with interruptions from many local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.\r\nThe script of the film went through several changes during filming. Due to the length of the film, scenes from a side-story involving the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play; Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.\r\nThe scenes shot at the Hospital maternity ward and the warehouse were shot at a new studio called \"The Coca-Cola Factory\" which was formerly a Coke bottling plant. The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot. The hospital segment's location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons. While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to give the appearance of night time, which allowed the crew to film at any time during the day. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days often losing track of the time of day. After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This led to having the last scene be one long five-minute scene of action to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during the scene when two characters go into an elevator to talk for twenty seconds, the crew changes the scene entirely and sets up the explosions for the scene to continue seamlessly. An accident occurred while filming the hospital sequence. Real glass was used and pieces of it flew toward Tony Leung and got into his eyes. Leung was sent to the hospital and after a week's rest, he returned to the set.

            "html": "<h2>Hard Boiled</h2><p>Hard Boiled (Chinese:\u8fa3\u624b\u795e\u63a2) is a 1992 Hong Kong action thriller film written by Barry Wong and directed by John Woo. It stars Chow Yun-fat as Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Alan, an undercover cop, and Anthony Wong as Johnny Wong, a leader of the criminal triads.</p><p>Hard Boiled was John Woo's last Hong Kong film before his transition to Hollywood. After making films that glamorized gangsters (and receiving criticism for doing so), Woo wanted to make a Dirty Harry styled film to glamorize the police. After the death of screenwriter Barry Wong, the film's screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. Woo were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby poisoning psychopath was cut.</p><p>The film was released in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception, but it was not as commercially successful as Woo's previous action films, such as A Better Tomorrow and The Killer. Reception from western critics was much more positive; many critics and film scholars have come to proclaim its action scenes as among the best ever filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled Stranglehold was released, which is in the process of being made into a film.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In a teahouse in Hong Kong, Royal Hong Kong Police inspectors \"Tequila\" Yuen and Benny Mak attempt to arrest a group of gun smugglers while they are making a deal. After an ambush from a rival gang member, a fierce gun battle breaks out. The gangsters are defeated but several police officers are badly wounded and Benny is killed. As revenge, Tequila executes the gangster who killed Benny rather than arrest him, much to the chagrin of his superintendent Pang, who needed the gangster alive to testify. Tequila is ordered off the case for his misdemeanor.</p><p>Elsewhere, Alan, an assassin under the employ of Triad boss \"Uncle\" Hoi, murders one of his subordinates who had double-crossed their clan for a rival syndicate led by upstart Johnny Wong. Wong, who is looking to usurp the old Triad bosses through his control of the illicit arms trade, is impressed by Alan's skill and attempts to recruit him. Alan reluctantly accepts the offer. Wong brings Alan on a raid on Hoi's warehouse, where many of Hoi's men are killed. Hoi is outnumbered; he asks Alan to kill him but spare his men. Alan does so and shoots Hoi's men as well. Tequila then attacks all of Wong's men. During the chaos, Alan spares Tequila's life.</p><p>Pang confirms to Tequila that Alan is an undercover cop. Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat to try to make sense of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang. Tequila and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, which allows Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes that one of his lieutenants, Foxy, is a police informant. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket earlier to prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is hidden in a vault beneath a nearby hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of the vault. While the two are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.</p><p>Alan and Tequila discover a hidden passage in the hospital leading to Wong's vault. There, Mad Dog confronts them in a shootout. The police and gangsters arrive at the hospital. Wong has the patients and staff taken hostage. Over the night, many gangsters and police are shot by each other. Mad Dog requests the hostages be released, but Wong refuses. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients. Pang evacuates the lobby while officer Teresa Chang goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and Tequila continue shooting gangsters, leading to Alan accidentally killing a cop. The duo eventually engage Mad Dog. While Tequila leaves to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with nurses and patients caught in the middle. They offer the group safe passage, but Wong shoots the group in a bid to kill Alan. For that, Mad Dog turns on Wong, but runs out of bullets. Wong kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.</p><p>Tequila shoots gangsters while protecting the last baby in the hospital. Alan and Tequila are confronted by Wong, who sets off bombs to blow up the building. Alan refuses to escape, choosing to pursue Wong. Tequila jumps out of the hospital while holding wire cables, saving the baby while the hospital explodes. Wong drags Alan outside at gunpoint as a hostage. Wong has Tequila humiliate himself. Alan grabs Wong's pistol and shoots himself through the stomach, giving Tequila the chance to shoot Wong dead.</p><p>To protect Alan from the triads, Pang and Tequila destroy Alan's personnel file and declare him dead, allowing him to leave Hong Kong to find a new life.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Chow Yun-fat as Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen Ho-yan: A clarinet-playing police officer whose partner is killed in a restaurant gunfight with a small army of gangsters.

Leung had previously worked with Woo on his film Bullet in the Head.</li><li>Teresa Mo as Teresa Chang: A fellow police officer who is the girlfriend of Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen. Chang helps decode the secret code songs that are sent to the police office by Alan.</li><li>Philip Chan as Supt. Pang: Prior to the film, Philip Chan was a police officer for about fifteen years.

After creating films which focused on the lives of gangsters, director John Woo wanted to make a film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.</p><p>Before production started, Woo told his actors that he was not going to make the film as stylish as his previous films, but to have it be more of an \"edgy thriller\". The role of Teresa Chang was originally made for actress Michelle Yeoh, who had a long relationship with producer Terence Chang. After casting Teresa Mo, the character of Teresa Chang was greatly re-written. The film's initial story was about Tony Leung's character being a psychopath who would poison baby food. When Terence Chang was making connections to have Woo make films in the United States, Chang found people uninterested and disgusted with the theme of babies being poisoned. This halted production for a month to develop a new story. Screenwriter Barry Wong was brought in to write a new story about Tony Leung's character being an undercover police officer. After writing the first part of the script, Wong went on a vacation outside Hong Kong, where he died leaving the script unfinished.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Hard Boiled took 123 days to shoot. Although Woo told his cast that the film would be more gritty and not as stylish as his previous films, Hard Boiled became more stylish as the filming began. The tea house sequence in the film was shot before the script was written. The crew found that the tea house was going to be torn down and decided to film a scene there. Woo saw the staircase in the tea house, and thought about a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while sliding down the banister. The tea house sequence was shot in around a week's time and was choreographed by Woo and Philip Kwok. It was shot with interruptions from many local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.</p><p>The script of the film went through several changes during filming. Due to the length of the film, scenes from a side-story involving the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play; Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.</p><p>The scenes shot at the Hospital maternity ward and the warehouse were shot at a new studio called \"The Coca-Cola Factory\" which was formerly a Coke bottling plant. The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot. The hospital segment's location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons. While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to give the appearance of night time, which allowed the crew to film at any time during the day. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days often losing track of the time of day. After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This led to having the last scene be one long five-minute scene of action to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during the scene when two characters go into an elevator to talk for twenty seconds, the crew changes the scene entirely and sets up the explosions for the scene to continue seamlessly. An accident occurred while filming the hospital sequence. Real glass was used and pieces of it flew toward Tony Leung and got into his eyes. Leung was sent to the hospital and after a week's rest, he returned to the set. Woo changed the ending of Hard Boiled after many members of the crew of the film felt that Leung's character should survive at the film's end.</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>Woo is a fan of jazz music and wanted this style for the soundtrack of Hard Boiled. Woo had also previously wanted a singer to perform a jazz song and have Chow Yun Fat's character play saxophone in his previous film The Killer. The producer for The Killer, Tsui Hark, rejected this idea for The Killer, feeling that Hong Kong audiences didn't enjoy and understand jazz music. The score heard in Hard Boiled was created by jazz musician Michael Gibbs. During promotional screenings, the score for the film was different and was described as \"very haunting music\" by film scholar Bey Logan. This score could not be used as the production crew could not get the rights to the music. Other songs featured in the film, include \"Hello\" by Lionel Richie and the traditional song \"Mona Lisa\". Woo chose these songs specifically for their lyrics to suggest that Tony was a sort of pen pal to Teresa. All the characters in Hard Boiled had their voices dubbed by their own actors to save money. Woo stated this was convenient as he did not have to worry about setting up boom mics and other sound elements.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical run</h4><p>Hard Boiled's was released on 16 April 1992 in Hong Kong. The film grossed HK$19,711,048 which was not as strong of a box office reception as Woo's previous action films A Better Tomorrow or The Killer.

This reception surprised producer Terence Chang who did not expect such a positive reaction.
