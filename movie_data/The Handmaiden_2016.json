It was released in South Korea on 1 June 2016, to critical acclaim. It grossed over $38 million worldwide.\r\nAt the 71st British Academy Film Awards, the film won the category of Best Film Not in the English Language.\r\nPlot\r\nPart 1\r\nIn Japanese-occupied Korea, a con man operating under the sobriquet of \"Count Fujiwara\" plans to seduce a Japanese heiress named Lady Hideko, then marry her and commit her to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. He hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee to become Hideko's maid and encourage Hideko to marry him.\r\nHideko lives with her Uncle Kouzuki, a Korean man who helped the Japanese take over his country in exchange for a gold mine. Kouzuki then uses this wealth to feed his obsession with rare books, selling forgeries to further accumulate money and books. Sook-hee's main job is to help Hideko prepare to read for Kouzuki's guests. Returning frustrated from a reading, Hideko demands Sook-hee sleep next to her. The two end up making love, under the pretext of preparing Hideko for her married life with the Count. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about the plan, but when Hideko herself suggests she loves someone other than the Count, Sook-hee insists on the marriage. Hideko slaps her and violently throws her from the room.\r\nWhen Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, Hideko and Fujiwara elope. After cashing out Hideko's inheritance, it is revealed that Hideko's na\u00efvet\u00e9 was part of the con. She and Fujiwara double-crossed Sook-hee and convinced the asylum that she is the \"Countess\" to have her committed in Hideko's stead.\r\nPart 2\r\nA series of flashbacks show that Hideko's \u201creading practice\u201d was in fact Kouzuki teaching her to erotically read sadistic pornography since she was five years old. The flashbacks show a regime of psychological and physical abuse that eventually degrades Hideko's aunt's sanity. Hideko's aunt is eventually found hanged from a tree in the yard, and Hideko takes over as the reader for the pornography auctions. When Hideko questions the description of a hanging in a book she has to read, Kouzuki tells her that he murdered her aunt using torture devices in the basement after she attempted to run away.\r\nIn the more recent past, the Count realizes seducing Hideko would be impossible and instead includes her in the plan to elope and then split her inheritance. When Hideko expresses her fear of her uncle, the Count promises her a vial of fast-acting poison as a wedding present, so that she can never be taken to the basement. Hideko demands the Count find her a girl to hire as a maid, to commit to an asylum in Hideko's place.\r\nWhile being instructed by the Count, who takes advantage of Sook-hee's illiteracy, Hideko unexpectedly falls in love with her. Hideko tries to confess her love, but when Sook-hee insists the marriage go on, Hideko throws her from the room and tries to hang herself. Sook-hee saves her and both admit to their plots. Hideko helps Sook-hee write a letter to her family to say she has teamed up with Hideko, and to hatch a plot to get Hideko and Sook-hee away from the men who have been manipulating them. Hideko shows Sook-hee the books she was forced to read and Sook-hee begins destroying the library. Hideko calls Sook-hee \"her savior\" and joins in destroying her uncle's collection.\r\nPart 3\r\nSook-hee's friend Bok-soon sets a fire at the asylum and poses as a firefighter to rescue Sook-hee. Hideko poisons Fujiwara's wine, causing him to pass out while she takes the money and leaves. The women reunite and flee together, disguising Hideko as a man to avoid detection.\r\nKouzuki captures Fujiwara upon receiving a letter from Hideko detailing Fujiwara's deception. He tortures Fujiwara in his cellar with his collection of antique bookmaking tools and presses him for sexual details about his niece. Fujiwara makes up a story about their wedding night but a flashback shows that he watched Hideko masturbate before cutting her hand on a knife to stain her sheets, refusing to consummate the marriage. When Kouzuki presses for more details, Fujiwara convinces him to give him one of his cigarettes. After smoking, a disgusted Fujiwara refuses to give further details. Kouzuki notices the cigarettes are producing blue smoke. Fujiwara reveals that his cigarettes had been laced with mercury and the toxic gas within the smoke kills them both.\r\nOn a ferry to Shanghai, China, Sook-hee and Hideko celebrate their newfound freedom by making love once again.\r\nCast\r\nKim Min-hee as Lady/Izumi Hideko\r\nKim Tae-ri as Maid/Nam Sook-hee\r\nHa Jung-woo as Count Fujiwara\r\nCho Jin-woong as Uncle Kouzuki\r\nKim Hae-sook as Butler Madame Sasaki\r\nMoon So-ri as Hideko's aunt\r\nLee Yong-nyeo as Bok-soon\r\nLee Dong-hwi as Goo-gai\r\nJo Eun-hyung as young Hideko\r\nRina Takagi as Hideko's mother\r\nHan Ha-na as Junko\r\nJeong Ha-dam as Housemaid\r\nChoi Byung-mo as Audience member\r\nProduction\r\nIn December 2014, it was reported that Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri, Ha Jung-woo and Cho Jin-woong signed on for the film. Kim Tae-ri was selected from 1,500 candidates to play the role. Shooting for the film began in June 2015 and concluded in October 2015.\r\nThe books The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife and Jin Ping Mei were featured in the film.\r\nRelease\r\nIn February 2016, CJ Entertainment announced that The Handmaiden was pre-sold to 116 countries, including to Amazon Studios for the US. The film premiered in competition at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation, and Ryu Seong-hee won the Vulcan Award of the Technical Artist for her art direction work on the film.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95%, based on 206 reviews, and an average score of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Handmaiden uses a Victorian crime novel as the loose inspiration for another visually sumptuous and absorbingly idiosyncratic outing from director Park Chan-wook.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". The Economist described the film as a masterpiece. Benjamin Lee of The Guardian ranked it four out of five stars and described it as \"a hugely entertaining thriller\".\r\nResponse to the explicit scenes\r\nThe film's numerous sexually explicit scenes between the two main female characters sparked some controversy. Laura Miller at Slate described the scenes as \"disappointingly boilerplate\" and featuring \"visual clich\u00e9s of pornographic lesbianism, bodies offered up for the camera\u2019s delectation.\" However, The New Yorker's Jia Tolentino said that \"the women know what they look like, it seems\u2014they are consciously performing for each other\u2014and Park is deft at extracting the particular sense of silly freedom that can be found in enacting a sexual clich\u00e9.\"\r\nTop ten lists\r\nThe Handmaiden was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists.\r\n1st \u2013 Danny Bowes, RogerEbert.com\r\n2nd \u2013 Dan Callahan, RogerEbert.com\r\n2nd \u2013 Noel Murray & Katie Rife, The A.V.
