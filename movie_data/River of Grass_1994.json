She fantasizes being a dancer, an acrobat, and a gymnast. One night at a bar she meets Lee. He's jobless, homeless, and unbeknownst to Cozy, is in possession of her father's handgun. Dad's a cop and lost the gun chasing a robber. Cozy and Lee climb a fence to swim in a pool. Playing around with the gun, they think they kill the pool's owner, so they go on the lam. An odd partnership develops even though they're short on ideas. But how can they escape their barren lot if they don't even have a quarter for the road toll?",

After getting dressed up to go to a bar she is nearly run over by Lee. Inside Lee buys Cozy a drink. He convinces her to break into a friend's home where they swim in a pool and Lee shows Cozy the gun that he was given by a friend who found it by the side of the road.

Of that theme, Reichardt said \"I guess it's just a good setup for different kinds of searching: question-asking, looking for the next place to go, what are you looking for, what are you leaving.

A limited theatrical re-release was planned for March 2016.\r\nCritical reception\r\nThe New York Times film critic Stephen Holden described River of Grass as having \"the look and feel of a sophisticated home movie featuring everyday people instead of actors.\" He praised the film's evocation of \"a sense of suffocating ennui,\" but criticized the story as too \"sketchily told\" and the dialogue as too \"fragmentary\" for the film to cohere.\r\nAccolades",
