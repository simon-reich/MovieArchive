    "plot": "Texas bar owner Julian Marty, who is generally regarded as not a nice person, hires shady private detective Loren Visser, who is able to obtain what Marty requests evidence - in this instance, photographic - that his wife, Abby, and one of his bartenders, Ray, are having an affair. As Ray and Abby realize that Marty has found out about them, it allows them to plan for their future away from Marty, while be up front with Marty about the situation. Marty, in turn, decides to hire Visser once again, this time to kill Abby and Ray, and dispose of their bodies so that they won't be found. The out in the open affair and the contract hit lead to some actions based on self interest, and a standoff of sorts between the four players, which is compounded in complexity by some wrong assumptions of what has happened, with an innocent bystander, another of the Marty's bartenders, Meurice, potentially and unwittingly adding to the scenario.",

It was the directorial debut of the Coens and the first major film of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who later became a noted director, as well as the feature-film debut of Joel Coen's wife Frances McDormand, who subsequently starred in many of his features.\r\nThe film's title derives from the Dashiell Hammett novel Red Harvest (1929), in which the term \"blood simple\" describes the addled, fearful mindset of people after prolonged immersion in violent situations.\r\nIn 2001, a director's cut was released, the same year that it was ranked number 98 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills.\r\nPlot\r\nAbby and Ray are driving through a heavy downpour at night, discussing Abby's bad marriage. Ray, a bartender at Marty's bar, drives to a motel, where they have sex. Abby's husband, Julian Marty, has hired a private detective, Lorren Visser, to follow Abby. Visser takes photos of the tryst and delivers them to Marty.\r\nAbby collects some things from home and warns Ray to stay away from the bar. Ray finds Marty on the bar\u2019s back steps, and asks Marty for two weeks pay. Marty refuses and angrily tells Ray it will be funny when Abby at some point looks at Ray and says \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything funny.\u201d\r\nMarty attempts to kidnap Abby from Ray's home. He fails, and humiliated, rehires Visser to kill the couple. Visser breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun (a gift from Marty), and once again photographs the sleeping couple through a window. He presents a doctored photo of the couple's \"corpses\" to Marty as evidence. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his fee. Visser shoots Marty with Abby's gun, leaving it at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty.\r\nRay returns to the bar and finds a motionless Marty, with a bullet wound in his chest. Assuming it is Abby who murdered Marty, he puts her gun in Marty's coat pocket and loads the still-bleeding body into the back seat of his car. As he is driving the body away from the crime scene, he perceives movement in his rearview mirror and pulls over in a panic. Returning to the car, Ray finds a barely-alive Marty crawling away from the car. Ray puts him back in the car and drives into a field to dig a grave. Marty is still breathing as Ray drags him to a shallow hole and starts burying him. Marty makes an attempt to use the gun on Ray, but Ray takes it and continues to bury Marty.\r\nA distraught and panicked Ray goes to Abby\u2019s new apartment and tells Abby he cleaned up her mess. They are unable to communicate about Marty. Abby, baffled, says \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything funny.\" By the time Ray leaves, each is convinced that the other has done something to harm Marty. Ray leaves the same pearl-handled gun with Abby.\r\nVisser observes first Abby and later Ray visiting the bar office. When leaving the bar, Ray notices that he is being followed, and leaves for Abby's apartment, realizing that she might be in danger. He sits in the dark waiting for Abby. After Abby arrives, Visser, firing from a nearby rooftop with a rifle, shoots Ray through the window, killing him. When Abby hears footsteps approaching, she quickly takes Ray's knife and hides in the bathroom. Visser enters the bathroom to kill her, but finds the bathroom empty and the window open. Reaching out the window, he opens another window to the next room where Abby is hiding. She slams the sash down and drives the knife through his hand into the sill, pinning Visser. He shoots vainly through the wall, finally punches through it and removes the knife while Abby retreats and waits outside the bathroom, holding her gun, now containing one round. As Visser is about to emerge, she fires through the door, hitting him. Abby says, \"I\u2019m not afraid of you, Marty\". Visser, lying mortally wounded on the bathroom floor, bursts into laughter and responds, \"If I see him, I'll sure give him the message.\" Abby is horrified at the realization that he is not Marty.\r\nCast\r\nJohn Getz as Ray\r\nFrances McDormand as Abby\r\nDan Hedaya as Julian Marty\r\nM. Emmet Walsh as Lorren Visser\r\nSamm-Art Williams as Meurice\r\nFunding\r\nThe Coen brothers took the trailer they made \u2013 which showed \"a man dragging a shovel alongside a car stopped in the middle of the road, back towards another man he was going to kill\" and \"a shot of backlit gun holes in a wall\" \u2013 and a projector and went around to people's homes and workplaces to show it. Daniel Bacaner was one of the first people to invest money in the project. He also became its executive producer and introduced the Coens to other potential backers. The entire process of raising the necessary $1.5 million took a year.\r\nProduction\r\nThe film was shot in several locations in the towns of Austin and Hutto, Texas over a period of 8 weeks in the fall of 1982. The film spent a year in postproduction and was completed by 1983.\r\nBlood Simple was Frances McDormand's screen debut. All Coen brothers films were actually co-directed by Joel and Ethan Coen although Ethan was credited as the co-writer and producer.\r\nReception\r\nWhile the film was only a modest box-office success, it was a huge critical success. It currently holds a 94% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 99 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.27/10. The critical consensus reads: \"Brutally violent and shockingly funny in equal measure, Blood Simple offers early evidence of the Coen Brothers' twisted sensibilities and filmmaking ingenuity.\" The movie made about $3 million. Its first big public viewing was the USA Film Festival in Dallas, followed by the Sundance Film Festival, where it received the Grand Jury Prize. The brothers took the film to the Toronto Film Festival, Cannes, and the New York Film Festival. They were very proud of their film, particularly in light of having raised the funds using their self-made trailer.\r\nJohn Simon of the National Review had a differing opinion, finding the film inept and detestable.\r\nDirector's cut and home media\r\nVHS versions\r\nThe original MCA Home Video VHS tape and LaserDisc was released on October 10, 1985, with a 96-minute running time.\r\nThe film was released on Universal Pictures Home Entertainment VHS tape for a second time in 1995 with a 99-minute run time.\r\nUnusual for such an exercise, the \"Director's Cut\" is some 3 minutes shorter than the original 1985 theatrical release. The Coens reduced the run time with tighter editing, shortening some shots and removing others altogether. Additionally, they resolved long-standing rights issues with the music; the original theatrical version of the film made prominent use of The Four Tops' \"It's the Same Old Song\" (1965); the Coens had replaced it with Neil Diamond's \"I'm a Believer\" (1966) for the 1995 U.S. home video edition on VHS. The Director's Cut reinstated the Four Tops track.\r\n2001 DVD release\r\nThe 2001 DVD release from Universal features several spoofs of DVD \"special features\". One is an introduction to the film by fictional film historian \"Mortimer Young\", who claims the Director's Cut removes some of \"the boring bits\" and adds other parts; this was also included in the theatrical release of the Director's Cut. It was also re-released on VHS in 2001.\r\nThe 2001 DVD release also includes an audio commentary by \"Kenneth Loring\", the fictional artistic director of the equally fictional \"Forever Young Films\". Loring offers several entirely spurious \"facts\"; for example, he claims the scene with Ray and Abby driving in the rain, talking about Marty, was acted out in reverse, as well as upside down, to synch the headlights of the passing car just as certain lines were said. (He claims filming the scene backwards and upside down was the logical choice to get the timing right, and the actors are wearing hair spray to keep their hair pointing \"down\".) Elsewhere in the commentary, he claims, in scenes with both dialogue and music, the actors simply mouth the words and record them in postproduction, so they do not interfere with the music; that Marty's dog is animatronic; that the sweat on various actors is \"movie sweat\", gathered from the flanks of Palomino horses; that Fred Astaire and Rosemary Clooney were at one time intended for the film; and that a fly buzzing about is not real, but the product of computer-generated imagery. \"Loring\" is voiced by actor Jim Piddock, using a script written by the Coen brothers.\r\nBox sets\r\nIn 2005, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released The Coen Brothers Collection DVD box set that included the 2001 version. Then in 2007, MGM Home Entertainment released The Coen Brothers Movie Collection DVD box set that included a version with no special features. The DVD was sold separately in 2008. Finally in 2011, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the From the Minds of the Coen Brothers Blu-ray Disc box set, which included the mock commentary track. The Blu-ray Disc was sold separately, as well.\r\nThe Criterion Collection\r\nIn 2016, The Criterion Collection released Blu-ray Disc and DVD special editions of the film with a new 4K digital transfer supervised and approved by Barry Sonnenfeld and the Coens, along with various new special features.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nCarter Burwell wrote the Blood Simple score, the first of his collaborations with the Coen brothers. Blood Simple was also the first feature-film score for Burwell, and after his work on this film, he became a much-in-demand composer in Hollywood. By 2016, he had scored 16 of the Coen brothers' films.\r\nThe score for Blood Simple is a mix of solo piano and electronic ambient sounds. One track, \"Monkey Chant\", is based on kecak, the \"Ramayana Monkey Chant\" of Bali.\r\nIn 1987, seven selections from Burwell's Blood Simple score were released on a 17-track album that also features selections from the soundtrack of the Coens' next film, Raising Arizona (1987).\r\nBlood Simple selections on the 1987 album:\r\nOther songs from the film that are not on the album:\r\n\"It's the Same Old Song\", written by Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland, performed by The Four Tops\r\n\"Louie Louie\", written by Richard Berry, performed by Toots & the Maytals\r\n\"The Lady in Red\", written by M. Dixon and A. Wrubel, performed by Xavier Cugat and his Orchestra\r\n\"Rogaciano\"\r\n\"He'll Have to Go\", written by Joe Allison and Audrey Allison, arranged by Jim Roberge, performed by Joan Black\r\n\"El Sueno\", written by Camilo Namen, performed by Johnny Ventura y su Combo\r\n\"Anahi\" performed by Maria Luisa Buchino and her Llameros\r\n\"Sweet Dreams\", written by Don Gibson, performed by Patsy Cline.",
