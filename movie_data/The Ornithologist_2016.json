He gets into his yellow kayak watching all kinds of beautiful birds. He is so intent looking through his binoculars his kayak is swept into rapids and capsizes.\r\nTwo Chinese women Fei and Lin are hiking through the woods and they find Fernando's body. The one woman is afraid and the other sees a duty to try and help. They resuscitate Fernando. He speaks Portuguese and they Chinese but English lets them communicate. He explains that they are lost and far off their route. The women are afraid of the forest spirits and he appears to be a non-believer. The women tie the man up in ropes from a tree. They ignore his pleas and promises of help. During the night he frees himself and he climbs high up a cliff for safety. His phone will not work.\r\nAfter a strange night of a full moon with tribal men dancing around a fire and the ritual killing of a boar, Fernando find Jesus. Jesus is a deaf and mute goat herder. Both men distrusts the other but after Jesus goes swimming naked Fernando joins him. Jesus shares his food, they sun bathe and Fernando shows Jesus how his binoculars work. They make love. Jesus uses his whistle and dog to round up his goats. Fernando sees that Jesus has his sweat shirt and gets angry. Jesus pulls out his knife and the two men fight. Fernando stabs and kills Jesus.\r\nFernando continues his journey finding an apple tree and bird eggs for food. He finds an old abandoned mission abbey with statues of saints and angels. He talks to some Koi fish in a pond and wonders did they survive the flood and who feeds them. He hears the sound of a horn and three topless women on horses are hunting with their dogs. There are elk and deer in the woods. The woman shoots an elk that disappears and Fernando looks as if he was hit by a bullet. She asks him is he Ok? They offer food and help. Is he lost? After he assures them he is fine they ride off.\r\nThe surreal experiences continue with a white dove watching him. He comes upon a dead body and he breathes it back to life. He died last night dancing with his friends. Who are you and am I dead? He tells him that he is Anthony. The now living man says that he is Thomas. Some things you can not understand but just believe. A spirit just burns within us. Should I believe a lie? I know I am dead. Anthony answers it is only a lie to you. You never died. You have my brother's whistle and knife. Did you kill Jesus? I am a new man and am here to correct a wrong.

It was released in 2016.</p><p>The film stars Paul Hamy as Fernando, an ornithologist studying black storks in Portugal, who is drawn into a series of incidents paralleling the life of Saint Anthony of Padua.</p><p>Director Jo\u00e3o Pedro Rodriguez has described his film as a \u201cpurposefully transgressive and blasphemous reappropriation of the saint\u2019s life.\u201d</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Fernando is out in nature camping on a riverbank birdwatching in Portugal. He gets into his yellow kayak watching all kinds of beautiful birds. He is so intent looking through his binoculars his kayak is swept into rapids and capsizes.</p><p>Two Chinese women Fei and Lin are hiking through the woods and they find Fernando's body. The one woman is afraid and the other sees a duty to try and help. They resuscitate Fernando. He speaks Portuguese and they Chinese but English lets them communicate. He explains that they are lost and far off their route. The women are afraid of the forest spirits and he appears to be a non-believer. The women tie the man up in ropes from a tree. They ignore his pleas and promises of help. During the night he frees himself and he climbs high up a cliff for safety. His phone will not work.</p><p>After a strange night of a full moon with tribal men dancing around a fire and the ritual killing of a boar, Fernando find Jesus. Jesus is a deaf and mute goat herder. Both men distrusts the other but after Jesus goes swimming naked Fernando joins him. Jesus shares his food, they sun bathe and Fernando shows Jesus how his binoculars work. They make love. Jesus uses his whistle and dog to round up his goats. Fernando sees that Jesus has his sweat shirt and gets angry. Jesus pulls out his knife and the two men fight. Fernando stabs and kills Jesus.</p><p>Fernando continues his journey finding an apple tree and bird eggs for food. He finds an old abandoned mission abbey with statues of saints and angels. He talks to some Koi fish in a pond and wonders did they survive the flood and who feeds them. He hears the sound of a horn and three topless women on horses are hunting with their dogs. There are elk and deer in the woods. The woman shoots an elk that disappears and Fernando looks as if he was hit by a bullet. She asks him is he Ok? They offer food and help. Is he lost? After he assures them he is fine they ride off.</p><p>The surreal experiences continue with a white dove watching him. He comes upon a dead body and he breathes it back to life. He died last night dancing with his friends. Who are you and am I dead? He tells him that he is Anthony. The now living man says that he is Thomas. Some things you can not understand but just believe. A spirit just burns within us. Should I believe a lie? I know I am dead. Anthony answers it is only a lie to you. You never died. You have my brother's whistle and knife. Did you kill Jesus? I am a new man and am here to correct a wrong. Thomas slices the neck of Fernando.</p><p>You hear the horn of a truck and see the city sign of Padua. Jesus and Fernando are walking into town and across the street the two Chinese women are waving and shouting friendly greetings.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Paul Hamy as Fernando</li><li>Xelo Cagiao as Jesus / Thomas (the brother of Jesus)</li><li>Jo\u00e3o Pedro Rodrigues as Anthony</li><li>Han Wen as Fei</li><li>Chan Suan as Lin</li><li>Juliane Elting as Blonde Hunter</li><li>Flora Bulc\u00e3o as Hunter 1</li><li>Isabelle Puntel as Hunter 2</li><li>Alexandre Alverca, Andr\u00e9 Freitas, David Silva Pereira, Gil Mendes Da Silva, Miguel \u00c2ngelo Marujo, Nuno Santos, Ricardo Jorge as caretos</li></ul><br/><h3>Awards</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"><th scope=\"col\">Award / Film Festival</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipients and nominees</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Denver International Film Festival</span></td><td>Krzysztof Kieslowski Award - Special Mention</td><th></th><td style=\"background: #99FF99; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2\">Won</td></tr><tr><td>Krzysztof Kieslowski Award for Best Film</td><th></th><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Locarno International Film Festival</span></td><td><span>Best Direction</span></td><td><span>Jo\u00e3o Pedro Rodrigues</span></td><td style=\"background: #99FF99; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2\">Won</td></tr><tr><td><span>Golden Leopard</span></td><th></th><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>"
