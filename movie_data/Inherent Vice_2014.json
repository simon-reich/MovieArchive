In 2016, it was voted the 75th best film since 2000 in an international critics' poll.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1970, Shasta Fay Hepworth visits the beach house of her ex-boyfriend, Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, a private investigator and hippie in Gordita Beach, Los Angeles County. She tells him about her new lover, Michael Z. \"Mickey\" Wolfmann, a wealthy real estate developer, and asks him to help prevent Mickey's wife and her lover from abducting Mickey and committing him to an insane asylum. Doc meets with Tariq Khalil, a member of the Black Guerrilla Family. Khalil hires Doc to find Glen Charlock, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood he met in jail, who owes him money and is one of Wolfmann's bodyguards. Doc visits Mickey's Channel View Estates project and enters the only business in the developing strip mall, a massage parlor, where he meets an employee, Jade. He searches the premises for Charlock, but is hit with a baseball bat and collapses. He awakens outside, lying next to Charlock's dead body and surrounded by policemen. Doc is interrogated by Detective Christian F. \"Bigfoot\" Bjornsen of the LAPD, and learns that Wolfmann has disappeared. He is helped by his attorney, Sauncho Smilax, who arranges for his release by the LAPD.\r\nDoc is hired by former heroin addict Hope Harlingen, who is looking for her missing husband, Coy. She was told that Coy was dead, but believes he is alive due to a large deposit to her bank account. Coy seeks out Doc and says he is hiding at a house in Topanga Canyon. In a second meeting, he reveals he is a police informant and fears for his life, only wanting to return to his wife and daughter. Jade leaves Doc a message apologizing for setting him up with the police and telling him to \"beware the Golden Fang.\" He meets her in an alley, where she explains that the Golden Fang is an international drug smuggling operation. Doc talks to Sauncho, who tells him about a suspicious boat called the Golden Fang and that, the last time the ship sailed, Shasta was on board. Thanks to a postcard from her, Doc finds a large building shaped like a golden fang and meets dentist Rudy Blatnoyd.\r\nBigfoot calls Doc and tells him that Blatnoyd has just been found dead with fang bites in his neck. Bigfoot decides to help Doc find Coy and tells him to search for Puck Beaverton in Chryskylodon, an asylum run by a cult connected to the Golden Fang. There, Doc finds Mickey, who is being watched by the FBI. Mickey tells Doc he felt guilty for the negativity his real-estate business caused and wants to give away his money. He appears to be a happy member of the cult. Doc also glimpses Puck and Coy. When Doc returns home to his beach house, he is greeted by Shasta, who has returned and is indifferent to the trouble her disappearance has caused. She confesses to having been on the Golden Fang on a \"three-hour tour\" and says she was brought along as inherent vice. She and Doc have sex.\r\nPenny, an assistant district attorney with whom Doc is having a fling, gives him confidential files from which he learns that the loan shark Adrian Prussia is paid by the police department to kill people for them and that one of his victims was Bigfoot's former partner. Prussia is tied to the Golden Fang, and Doc learns that Glen Charlock was involved with a deal, which is why he was killed. Doc visits Adrian, noticing his obsession with baseball bats, but is abducted and drugged by his partner, Puck. He manages to escape, killing both Puck and Adrian. Bigfoot appears and rescues him, driving him home, but Doc discovers he has been set up: Bigfoot has planted heroin in his car. Doc arranges for the drugs to be returned to the Golden Fang in exchange for Coy's freedom. Doc and Shasta drive off together.\r\nCast\r\nJoaquin Phoenix as Larry \"Doc\" Sportello\r\nJosh Brolin as Lt. Det.

Anderson originally adapted the entire 384-page novel sentence by sentence which made it easier for him to cut down the script than the novel. By February 2011, Anderson had written a first draft and was more than halfway done with a second draft. The first draft was written without a narrator but the character of Sortil\u00e8ge was later turned into the voice of the narrator. In September 2012, Anderson stated that he was still writing the script but was hoping he could get Inherent Vice into production and have a few years of being more productive.\r\nThis is the first film adaptation from a Thomas Pynchon novel with Anderson describing it \"like a Cheech & Chong movie\". Years prior, Anderson considered adapting Pynchon's 1990 novel Vineland, but could not figure out how. When Inherent Vice came out, he was drawn to it and wrote the film concurrently with The Master. Anderson significantly changed the ending from the novel and described the novel as \"deeply written and beautifully profound stuff mixed in with just the best fart jokes and poop jokes that you can imagine.\" Anderson drew inspiration from Kiss Me Deadly, The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye, and Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke. Anderson has said he tried to cram as many jokes onto the screen as Pynchon squeezed onto the page and that the visual gags and gimmicks were inspired by Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker-style slapstick spoofs like Police Squad!, Top Secret!, and Airplane!. Anderson also used the underground comic strip Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers as what he has described as an invaluable \"research bible\" for the writing process.\r\nCasting\r\nRobert Downey Jr. was reportedly interested in the role of Larry \"Doc\" Sportello and was making plans to start shooting in the fall of 2011 since he had dropped out of Oz the Great and Powerful. Downey Jr. stated in December 2011 that the planned collaboration was \"probably true\". In January 2013, it was reported that Joaquin Phoenix was in talks for the lead and that Downey Jr. had ultimately passed on the role. Downey Jr. later said that Anderson wanted to make the film with Phoenix because he was too old.\r\nIn May 2013, it was reported that Benicio del Toro, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Martin Short, and Jena Malone were in talks to join the film. In May 2013, it was reported that Josh Brolin joined the cast and that Katherine Waterston joined as the lead female role. In June 2013, it was reported that Peter McRobbie and Sasha Pieterse joined the cast. In July 2013, it was reported that Timothy Simons joined the cast. In October 2013, it was reported that Michael K. Williams joined the cast.\r\nIn September 2014, it was reported that Pynchon may have a cameo in the film, which Anderson would not confirm, citing Pynchon's choice to stay out of the public spotlight. Brolin went as far as to confirm the cameo and claimed that Pynchon was on set but that nobody knew it was he as he stayed in the corner.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in May 2013, and it was reported that shooting was to take place until August 2, 2013. Shooting permits in California covered a San Fernando Valley warehouse, a storefront on Slauson Boulevard, driving shots in the Canoga Park area, driving shots in canyon roads above Malibu and a warehouse in Chinatown. In June 2014, filming also took place in Pasadena, and aboard the tall ship American Pride located in Long Beach.\r\nThe set has been described as organized chaos but the cast felt protected when they took big risks. Short stated that \"If you're working with a great director, you feel very, very, very safe because you know that all the decisions will be made months later in the editing room.\" Malone stated that \"it was a very structured process\" and that the \"chaos can only come from a grounded, logical base because you have to know where you're going to be spinning from. The logic becomes the chaos and the chaos becomes the logic.\"\r\nAccording to Waterston, Anderson did not have a clear goal while on set but it did not feel chaotic. Brolin said \"It was crazy, chaotic but really, really gratifying.\" Brolin also stated that there was \"a really strange lack of pretense\" but that Anderson would work with the actors when they felt something was not working. Pieterse stated that Anderson allowed \"freedom and flexibility to really dive into your character and shape the scene\". Wilson said \"Sometimes I wouldn't necessarily know what I was doing. We were encouraged to kind of do anything.\"\r\nSoundtrack\r\nThe Inherent Vice soundtrack was composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London. It was Greenwood's third collaboration with Anderson, following There Will Be Blood and The Master.\r\nThe score includes a version of an unreleased Radiohead song, \"Spooks\", performed by Greenwood and members of Supergrass. Greenwood said Radiohead's version was \"a half-idea we never made work live\", describing it as a pastiche of the Pixies and surf music. The soundtrack also includes tracks from the late 1960s and early 1970s by Neil Young, Can, and the Marketts, among others. It was released by Nonesuch Records on December 16.\r\nRelease\r\nInherent Vice premiered as the centerpiece at the New York Film Festival on October 4, 2014. The film received a limited release on December 12, 2014, before being released in 645 theaters on January 9, 2015.\r\nThis film earned $8 million domestically and $6.6 million internationally, despite the positive reviews bringing its final gross to $14.6 million\u2014around six million short of earning its budget back.\r\nReception\r\nInherent Vice was met with positive reviews. Critics praised the film for its performances, particularly those of Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin and Katherine Waterston, while some were frustrated by its complicated plot. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 74%, based on 242 reviews, with an average rating of 7.17/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Inherent Vice may prove frustrating for viewers who demand absolute coherence, but it does justice to its acclaimed source material \u2013 and should satisfy fans of director P.T. Anderson.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nFilm Journal International's Ethan Alter commented that the film is \"confounding, challenging and consistently unique.\" IGN reviewer Matt Patches gave the film an 8.9 out of 10 score, saying \"There's nothing certain \u2013 a surprisingly rewarding sensation that demands repeat viewings. There's so much, too much, to soak up, and all the laughter Anderson piles on top of the thematics means there's plenty to miss. Inherent Vice is a high grain strain: Provocative, hilarious, and its own breed of weird.\" Collider's Adam Chitwood named it one of the top ten films of 2014.\r\nThe film was ranked 75th in a survey of 177 critics conducted by the BBC in 2016 to determine the 100 best films of the 21st century.\r\nTop ten lists\r\nInherent Vice was listed on many film critics' top ten lists of 2014 films.\r\n1st: Drew McWeeny, HitFix\r\n1st: Glenn Kenny & Matt Zoller Seitz, RogerEbert.com\r\n1st: Ben Kenigsberg, The A.V.

Short stated that \"If you're working with a great director, you feel very, very, very safe because you know that all the decisions will be made months later in the editing room.\" Malone stated that \"it was a very structured process\" and that the \"chaos can only come from a grounded, logical base because you have to know where you're going to be spinning from. The logic becomes the chaos and the chaos becomes the logic.\"</p><p>According to Waterston, Anderson did not have a clear goal while on set but it did not feel chaotic. Brolin said \"It was crazy, chaotic but really, really gratifying.\" Brolin also stated that there was \"a really strange lack of pretense\" but that Anderson would work with the actors when they felt something was not working. Pieterse stated that Anderson allowed \"freedom and flexibility to really dive into your character and shape the scene\". Wilson said \"Sometimes I wouldn't necessarily know what I was doing. We were encouraged to kind of do anything.\"</p><h4>Soundtrack</h4><p>The Inherent Vice soundtrack was composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London. It was Greenwood's third collaboration with Anderson, following There Will Be Blood and The Master.</p><p>The score includes a version of an unreleased Radiohead song, \"Spooks\", performed by Greenwood and members of Supergrass. Greenwood said Radiohead's version was \"a half-idea we never made work live\", describing it as a pastiche of the Pixies and surf music. The soundtrack also includes tracks from the late 1960s and early 1970s by Neil Young, Can, and the Marketts, among others. It was released by Nonesuch Records on December 16.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>Inherent Vice premiered as the centerpiece at the New York Film Festival on October 4, 2014. The film received a limited release on December 12, 2014, before being released in 645 theaters on January 9, 2015.</p><p>This film earned $8 million domestically and $6.6 million internationally, despite the positive reviews bringing its final gross to $14.6 million\u2014around six million short of earning its budget back.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>Inherent Vice was met with positive reviews. Critics praised the film for its performances, particularly those of Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin and Katherine Waterston, while some were frustrated by its complicated plot. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 74%, based on 242 reviews, with an average rating of 7.17/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Inherent Vice may prove frustrating for viewers who demand absolute coherence, but it does justice to its acclaimed source material \u2013 and should satisfy fans of director P.T. Anderson.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Film Journal International's Ethan Alter commented that the film is \"confounding, challenging and consistently unique.\" IGN reviewer Matt Patches gave the film an 8.9 out of 10 score, saying \"There's nothing certain \u2013 a surprisingly rewarding sensation that demands repeat viewings. There's so much, too much, to soak up, and all the laughter Anderson piles on top of the thematics means there's plenty to miss. Inherent Vice is a high grain strain: Provocative, hilarious, and its own breed of weird.\" Collider's Adam Chitwood named it one of the top ten films of 2014.</p><p>The film was ranked 75th in a survey of 177 critics conducted by the BBC in 2016 to determine the 100 best films of the 21st century.</p><h4>Top ten lists</h4><p>Inherent Vice was listed on many film critics' top ten lists of 2014 films.</p><ul><li>1st: Drew McWeeny, HitFix</li><li>1st: Glenn Kenny & Matt Zoller Seitz, RogerEbert.com</li><li>1st: Ben Kenigsberg, The A.V.
