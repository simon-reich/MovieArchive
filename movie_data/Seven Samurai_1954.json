The plan is inadvertently overheard by a farmer, whereupon the villagers ask Gisaku, the village elder and miller, for advice. He states that he once saw a village that had hired samurai and remained untouched by raiders, and declares they should also hire samurai to defend themselves. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises them to find hungry samurai.\r\nAfter having little success initially, the scouting group watches Kambei, an aging but experienced r\u014dnin, rescue a young boy who had been taken hostage by a thief. A young samurai named Katsushir\u014d asks to become Kambei's disciple. The villagers then ask for help, and after initial reluctance, Kambei agrees. He recruits his old friend Shichir\u014dji and, with Katsushir\u014d's assistance, three other samurai: the friendly, wily Gorobei; the good-willed Heihachi; and Ky\u016bz\u014d, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushir\u014d regards with awe. Although inexperienced, Katsushir\u014d is accepted because time is short. Kikuchiyo, a wild and unpredictable man who carries a family scroll that he claims proves he is a samurai (though the birth date on it is for a teenager), follows the group despite attempts to drive him away.\r\nOn arrival, the samurai find the villagers cowering in their homes, refusing to greet them. Feeling insulted by such a cold reception, Kikuchiyo rings the village alarm, prompting the villagers to come out of hiding and beg for the samurais\u2019 protection. The samurai are both pleased and amused by this, and accept him as a comrade-in-arms. Slowly the samurai and farmers begin to trust each other as they train together. Katsushir\u014d forms a relationship with Shino, a farmer's daughter, who is masquerading at her father\u2019s insistence as a boy for protection from the supposedly lustful samurai. However, the six professional samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers most likely acquired by killing injured or dying samurai. Kikuchiyo retorts in a rage that samurai are responsible for battles, raids, taxation and forced labor that devastate the villagers' lives. By so doing, he reveals his origin as an orphaned farmer's son. The samurais' anger turns to shame.\r\nPart Two\r\nThree bandit scouts are spotted. Two are killed, while another reveals the location of their camp. Against the wishes of the samurai, the villagers kill the prisoner. The samurai burn down the bandits' camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager who helps the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who had apparently been kidnapped and made a concubine in a previous raid. On seeing Rikichi, she walks back into the burning hut. Heihachi is accidentally killed trying to save Rikichi, whose grief is compounded.\r\nWhen the bandits finally attack, they are confounded by new fortifications, including a moat and wooden fence. Several bandits are killed following Kambei's plan of allowing single horse-mounted bandits to enter the village, where they are trapped and killed by groups of farmers armed with bamboo spears. Gisaku\u2019s family tries to save the old man when he refuses to abandon his mill on the outskirts of the village. All perish but a lone baby rescued by Kikuchiyo, who breaks down in tears, as it reminds him how he was orphaned.\r\nThe bandits possess three matchlock firearms. Ky\u016bz\u014d ventures out alone and returns with one. An envious Kikuchiyo abandons his post\u2014and his contingent of farmers\u2014to bring back another. He is chastised by Kambei because, while he was gone, the bandits killed some of his farmers. The bandits attack again, and Gorobei is slain. That night, Kambei predicts that, due to their dwindling numbers, the bandits will make one last all-out attack. Meanwhile, Katsushir\u014d and Shino's relationship is discovered by her father. He beats her until Kambei and the villagers intervene. Shichir\u014dji calms everyone down by saying the couple should be forgiven because they are young and that passions can run high before any battle.\r\nThe next morning in a torrential downpour, Kambei orders that the remaining thirteen bandits be allowed into the village. As the battle winds down, their leader, armed with a gun, hides in the women's hut and shoots Ky\u016bz\u014d. An enraged Kikuchiyo charges in and is shot, but kills the bandit chief before dying. The rest of the invaders are slain.\r\nThe three surviving samurai later watch from the funeral mounds of their comrades as the joyful villagers sing whilst planting their crops. Kambei reflects that it is another pyrrhic victory for the warriors: \"In the end we lost this battle too. The victory belongs to the peasants, not to us.\"\r\nCast\r\nThe seven samurai\r\nToshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo (\u83ca\u5343\u4ee3), a humorous, mercurial and temperamental rogue who lies about being a samurai, but eventually proves his worth and resourcefulness.\r\nTakashi Shimura as Kambei Shimada (\u5cf6\u7530\u52d8\u5175\u885b, Shimada Kanbei), a war-weary but honourable and strategic r\u014dnin, and the leader of the seven.\r\nDaisuke Kat\u014d as Shichir\u014dji (\u4e03\u90ce\u6b21), Kambei's old friend and former lieutenant.\r\nIsao Kimura as Katsushir\u014d Okamoto (\u5ca1\u672c\u52dd\u56db\u90ce, Okamoto Katsushir\u014d), the untested son of a wealthy landowner samurai, whom Kambei reluctantly takes in as a disciple.\r\nMinoru Chiaki as Heihachi Hayashida (\u6797\u7530\u5e73\u516b, Hayashida Heihachi), an amiable though less-skilled fighter, whose charm and wit maintain his comrades' morale in the face of adversity.\r\nSeiji Miyaguchi as Ky\u016bz\u014d (\u4e45\u8535), a serious, stone-faced and supremely skilled swordsman.\r\nYoshio Inaba as Gor\u014dbei Katayama (\u7247\u5c71\u4e94\u90ce\u5175\u885b, Katayama Gor\u014dbei), a skilled archer, who acts as Kambei's second-in-command and helps create the master plan for the village's defense.\r\nVillagers\r\nYoshio Tsuchiya as Rikichi (\u5229\u5409), a hotheaded villager\r\nBokuzen Hidari as Yohei (\u4e0e\u5e73), a timid old man\r\nYukiko Shimazaki as Rikichi's wife\r\nKamatari Fujiwara as Manz\u014d (\u4e07\u9020), a farmer who disguises his daughter as a man to try to protect her from the samurai\r\nKeiko Tsushima as Shino (\u5fd7\u4e43), Manz\u014d's daughter\r\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d as Gisaku (\u5100\u4f5c), the village patriarch, referred to as \"Grandad\"\r\nYoshio Kosugi as Mosuke, one of the farmers sent to town to hire the samurai\r\nOthers\r\nShinpei Takagi as the bandit chief\r\nShin Otomo as the bandit second-in-command\r\nHaruo Nakajima as a bandit\r\nEijir\u014d T\u014dno as a thief\r\nAtsushi Watanabe as a bun seller\r\nJun Tatara as a coolie\r\nSachio Sakai as a coolie\r\nTakeshi Seki as a coolie\r\nTatsuya Nakadai as a samurai wandering through town (uncredited)\r\nProduction\r\nAkira Kurosawa had originally wanted to direct a film about a single day in the life of a samurai. Later, in the course of his research, he discovered a story about samurai defending farmers. According to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called Six Samurai, with Mifune playing the role of Kyuzo. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that \"six sober samurai were a bore\u2014they needed a character that was more off-the-wall\". Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise actions in his performance.\r\nLong before it was released, the film had already become a topic of wide discussion. After three months of pre-production it had 148 shooting days spread out over a year\u2014four times the span covered in the original budget, which eventually came to almost half a million dollars. Toho Studios closed down production at least twice. Each time, Kurosawa calmly went fishing, reasoning that the studio had already heavily invested in the production and would allow him to complete the picture. The film's final battle scene, originally scheduled to be shot at the end of summer, was shot in February in near-freezing temperatures. Mifune later recalled that he had never been so cold in his life.\r\nWriting\r\nKurosawa and the writers were innovative in refining the theme of the assembly of heroic characters to perform a mission. According to Michael Jeck's DVD commentary, Seven Samurai was among the first films to use the now-common plot element of the recruiting and gathering of heroes into a team to accomplish a specific goal, a device used in later films such as The Guns of Navarone, Sholay, the western remake The Magnificent Seven, and Pixar's animated film A Bug's Life. Film critic Roger Ebert speculates in his review that the sequence introducing the leader Kambei (in which the samurai shaves off his topknot, a sign of honor among samurai, in order to pose as a monk to rescue a boy from a kidnapper) could be the origin of the practice, now common in action movies, of introducing the main hero with an undertaking unrelated to the main plot. Other plot devices such as the reluctant hero, romance between a local woman and the youngest hero, and the nervousness of the common citizenry, had appeared in other films before this but were combined in this film.\r\nSet design\r\nKurosawa refused to shoot the peasant village at Toho Studios and had a complete set constructed at Tagata on the Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka. Although the studio protested the increased production costs, Kurosawa was adamant that \"the quality of the set influences the quality of the actors' performances... For this reason, I have the sets made exactly like the real thing. It restricts the shooting but encourages that feeling of authenticity.\" He also spoke of 'intense labour' of making the film: \"It rained all the time, we didn't have enough horses. It was just the kind of picture that is impossible to make in this country.\"\r\nFilming\r\nThrough the creative freedom provided by the studio, Kurosawa made use of telephoto lenses, which were rare in 1954, as well as multiple cameras which allowed the action to fill the screen and place the audience right in the middle of it. \"If I had filmed it in the traditional shot-by-shot method, there was no guarantee that any action could be repeated in exactly the same way twice.\" He found it to be very effective and he later used it in movies that were less action-oriented. His method was to put one camera in the most orthodox shooting position, another camera for quick shots and a third camera \"as a kind of guerrilla unit\". This method made for very complicated shoots, for which Kurosawa choreographed the movement of all three cameras by using diagrams.\r\nThe martial arts choreography for the film was led by Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b. Initially Junzo Sasamori of the Ono-ha Itto-ryu was working along with Sugino, but he was asked by the Ministry of Education to teach in Europe during production.\r\nEditing\r\nDuring filming Kurosawa quickly earned a reputation with his crew as the \"world's greatest editor\" because of his practice of editing late at night throughout the shooting. He described this as a practical necessity that is incomprehensible to most directors, who on major production spent at least several months with their editors assembling and cutting the film after shooting is completed.:89\r\nSoundtrack\r\nKurosawa had a heightened interest in the soundtracks of his films. For The Seven Samurai, he collaborated for the seventh and penultimate time with friend and composer Fumio Hayasaka who wrote one of his best soundtracks. Hayasaka was already seriously ill when Kurosawa visited him during the filming of the Seven Samurai and he died prematurely of tuberculosis on October 15, 1955, at the age of 41, while Kurosawa was filming I Live in Fear, Kurosawa's next film, which Hayasaka was unable to complete.\r\nRelease\r\nAt 207 minutes, including a five-minute intermission with music, Seven Samurai would be the longest picture of Kurosawa's career. Fearing that American audiences would be unwilling to sit through the entire picture, Toho Studios originally removed 50 minutes from the film for U.S. distribution. Similar edits were distributed around the world until the 1990s; since then the complete version is usually seen.\r\nHome video\r\nPrior to the advent of DVD, various edited versions were distributed on video, but most DVDs and Blu-rays contain Kurosawa's complete original version, including its five-minute intermission. Since 2006, the Criterion Collection's US releases have featured their own exclusive 2K restoration, whereas most others, including all non-US Blu-rays, have an older HD transfer from Toho in Japan.\r\n4K restoration\r\nIn 2016, Toho carried out a six-month-long 4K restoration, along with Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952). As the whereabouts of Seven Samurai's original negative is unknown, second generation fine grain positive and third generation duplicate negative elements were used. As of 2020, this version has not been released anywhere on home video.\r\nReception\r\nSeven Samurai was well-received by Japanese audiences, grossing \u00a5268 million in the first 12 months of its release. Eventually, it became Japan's third highest-grossing film of 1954. Overseas, the film's 2002 re-release grossed $271,841 in the United States and $4,124 in France. As of 2017, Seven Samurai is the best-selling home video title ever released by the British Film Institute.\r\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a perfect approval rating of 100% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 9.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Arguably Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, The Seven Samurai is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made\". It currently ranks 18th on their action/adventure voting list, and seventh on their top 100 art house and international films.\r\nIn 1982, it was voted number three in the Sight & Sound critics' poll of greatest films. In the Sight & Sound directors' poll, it was voted at number ten in 1992 and number nine in 2002. It also ranked number seventeen on the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, in both cases being tied with Kurosawa's own Rashomon (1950). Seven Samurai has also been ranked number one on Empire magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\r\nKurosawa both directed and edited many of his films, including Seven Samurai. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed Seven Samurai as the 33rd best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members. In 2018, it was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's poll of 209 critics in 43 countries.\r\nLegacy\r\nSeven Samurai was a technical and creative watershed that became Japan's highest-grossing movie and set a new standard for the industry. It is largely touted as what made the \"assembling the team\" trope popular in movies and other media.\r\nIts influence can be most strongly felt in the Western The Magnificent Seven (1960), a film specifically adapted from Seven Samurai. Director John Sturges took Seven Samurai and adapted it to the Old West, with the samurai replaced by gunslingers. Many of The Magnificent Seven's scenes mirror those of Seven Samurai.\r\nHowever, in an interview with R. B. Gadi, Kurosawa expressed how \"the American copy of The Magnificent Seven is a disappointment, although entertaining. It is not a version of Seven Samurai\".:42 Stephen Prince argues that considering samurai films and Westerns respond to different cultures and contexts, what Kurosawa found useful was not their content but rather he was inspired by their levels of syntactic movement, framing, form and grammar.\r\nThe Invincible Six (1970), an American action film directed by Jean Negulesco, has been described as \"a knockoff of the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven genre set in 1960s Iran.\"\r\nBattle Beyond the Stars (1980) is an American science fiction film directed by Jimmy T. Murakami and produced by Roger Corman. The film, intended as a \"Magnificent Seven in outer space\", is based on the plots of The Magnificent Seven and Seven Samurai. The movie acknowledges its debt to Seven Samurai by calling the protagonist's homeworld Akir and its inhabitants the Akira.\r\nThe plot of Seven Samurai was re-worked for The Seven Magnificent Gladiators (1983), an Italian sword-and-sandal film.\r\nThe steampunk anime series Samurai 7 (2004) is based on Seven Samurai.\r\nSome film critics have noted similarities between Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998) and Seven Samurai.\r\nSeveral elements from The Seven Samurai are also argued to have been adapted for Star Wars (1977). The Clone Wars episode \"Bounty Hunters\" (2008) pays direct homage to Akira Kurosawa by adapting the film's plot, as does The Mandalorian episode Chapter 4: Sanctuary (2019).\r\nSeven Swords (2005), a Hong Kong wuxia film produced and directed by Tsui Hark has a plot revolving around seven warriors helping villagers to defend against mercenaries, in homage to Seven Samurai.\r\nThere have been pachinko machines based on Seven Samurai in Japan. Seven Samurai pachinko machines have sold 94,000 units in Japan as of March 2018, grossing approximately $470 million.\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nWinner - Silver Lion - Akira Kurosawa\r\nNominated - Golden Lion - Akira Kurosawa\r\nWinner - Best Supporting Actor - Seiji Miyaguchi\r\nNominated - BAFTA Award for Best Film\r\nNominated - BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor - Toshiro Mifune\r\nNominated - BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor - Takashi Shimura\r\nNominated - Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White - So Matsuyama\r\nNominated - Best Costume Design, Black-and-White - Kohei Ezaki\r\nWinner - Best Foreign Director - Akira Kurosawa\r\nWinner - Best Foreign Actor - Takashi Shimura",

The story takes place in 1586 during the Sengoku period of Japanese history. It follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven r\u014dnin (masterless samurai) to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.</p><p>Since its release, Seven Samurai has consistently ranked highly in critics' lists of the greatest films, such as the BFI's Sight & Sound and Rotten Tomatoes polls. It was also voted the greatest foreign-language film in BBC's 2018 international critics' poll. It has remained highly influential, often seen as one of the most \"remade, reworked, referenced\" films in cinema.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><h4>Part One</h4><p>Bandits discuss raiding a mountain village, but their chief decides to wait until after the harvest as they had raided it fairly recently. The plan is inadvertently overheard by a farmer, whereupon the villagers ask Gisaku, the village elder and miller, for advice. He states that he once saw a village that had hired samurai and remained untouched by raiders, and declares they should also hire samurai to defend themselves. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises them to find hungry samurai.</p><p>After having little success initially, the scouting group watches Kambei, an aging but experienced r\u014dnin, rescue a young boy who had been taken hostage by a thief.

He recruits his old friend Shichir\u014dji and, with Katsushir\u014d's assistance, three other samurai: the friendly, wily Gorobei; the good-willed Heihachi; and Ky\u016bz\u014d, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushir\u014d regards with awe. Although inexperienced, Katsushir\u014d is accepted because time is short. Kikuchiyo, a wild and unpredictable man who carries a family scroll that he claims proves he is a samurai (though the birth date on it is for a teenager), follows the group despite attempts to drive him away.</p><p>On arrival, the samurai find the villagers cowering in their homes, refusing to greet them.

For The Seven Samurai, he collaborated for the seventh and penultimate time with friend and composer Fumio Hayasaka who wrote one of his best soundtracks. Hayasaka was already seriously ill when Kurosawa visited him during the filming of the Seven Samurai and he died prematurely of tuberculosis on October 15, 1955, at the age of 41, while Kurosawa was filming I Live in Fear, Kurosawa's next film, which Hayasaka was unable to complete.</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption class=\"tlheader mbox-text\" style=\"text-align:left;background-color:#fff;font-weight:700\">Original track list</caption><tbody><tr><th class=\"tlheader\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:right;background-color:#eee\"><abbr title=\"Number\">No.</abbr></th><th class=\"tlheader\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:left;background-color:#eee\">Title</th><th class=\"tlheader\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;padding-right:10px;text-align:right;background-color:#eee\">Length</th></tr><tr style=\"background-color:#fff\"><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">1.</td><td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\"Opening\" <span>(<span lang=\"ja\">\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af</span>, 'Start')</span></td><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">3:17</td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">2.</td><td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\"To the small water mill\" <span>(<span lang=\"ja\">\u6c34\u8eca\u5c0f\u5c4b\u3078</span>, 'To the small water mill')</span></td><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">1:00</td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:#fff\"><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">3.</td><td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\"In Search of Samurai 1\" <span>(<span lang=\"ja\">\u4f8d\u63a2\u3057 \u4e00</span>, 'In Search of Samurai 1')</span></td><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">0:49</td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">4.</td><td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\"Kanbei and Katsushiro - The Mambo of Kikuchiyo\" <span>(<span lang=\"ja\">\u52d8\u5175\u885b\u3068\u52dd\u56db\u90ce\uff5e\u83ca\u5343\u4ee3\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30dc</span>, 'Kanbei and Katsushiro - The Mambo of Kikuchiyo')</span></td><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">3:43</td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:#fff\"><td style=\"padding-right:10px;text-align:right;vertical-align:top\">5.</td><td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\"Rikichi's Tears?

longest picture of Kurosawa's career. Fearing that American audiences would be unwilling to sit through the entire picture, Toho Studios originally removed 50 minutes from the film for U.S. distribution. Similar edits were distributed around the world until the 1990s; since then the complete version is usually seen.</p><h4>Home video</h4><p>Prior to the advent of DVD, various edited versions were distributed on video, but most DVDs and Blu-rays contain Kurosawa's complete original version, including its five-minute intermission. Since 2006, the Criterion Collection's US releases have featured their own exclusive 2K restoration, whereas most others, including all non-US Blu-rays, have an older HD transfer from Toho in Japan.</p><h4>4K restoration</h4><p>In 2016, Toho carried out a six-month-long 4K restoration, along with Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952). As the whereabouts of Seven Samurai's original negative is unknown, second generation fine grain positive and third generation duplicate negative elements were used. As of 2020, this version has not been released anywhere on home video.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>Seven Samurai was well-received by Japanese audiences, grossing \u00a5268 million in the first 12 months of its release. Eventually, it became Japan's third highest-grossing film of 1954. Overseas, the film's 2002 re-release grossed $271,841 in the United States and $4,124 in France. As of 2017, Seven Samurai is the best-selling home video title ever released by the British Film Institute.</p><p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a perfect approval rating of 100% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 9.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Arguably Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, The Seven Samurai is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made\". It currently ranks 18th on their action/adventure voting list, and seventh on their top 100 art house and international films.</p><p>In 1982, it was voted number three in the Sight & Sound critics' poll of greatest films. In the Sight & Sound directors' poll, it was voted at number ten in 1992 and number nine in 2002. It also ranked number seventeen on the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, in both cases being tied with Kurosawa's own Rashomon (1950). Seven Samurai has also been ranked number one on Empire magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.</p><p>Kurosawa both directed and edited many of his films, including Seven Samurai. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed Seven Samurai as the 33rd best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members. In 2018, it was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's poll of 209 critics in 43 countries.</p><br/><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Seven Samurai was a technical and creative watershed that became Japan's highest-grossing movie and set a new standard for the industry. It is largely touted as what made the \"assembling the team\" trope popular in movies and other media.</p><p>Its influence can be most strongly felt in the Western The Magnificent Seven (1960), a film specifically adapted from Seven Samurai. Director John Sturges took Seven Samurai and adapted it to the Old West, with the samurai replaced by gunslingers. Many of The Magnificent Seven's scenes mirror those of Seven Samurai.</p><p>However, in an interview with R. B. Gadi, Kurosawa expressed how \"the American copy of The Magnificent Seven is a disappointment, although entertaining. It is not a version of Seven Samurai\".:42 Stephen Prince argues that considering samurai films and Westerns respond to different cultures and contexts, what Kurosawa found useful was not their content but rather he was inspired by their levels of syntactic movement, framing, form and grammar.</p><p>The Invincible Six (1970), an American action film directed by Jean Negulesco, has been described as \"a knockoff of the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven genre set in 1960s Iran.\"</p><p>Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) is an American science fiction film directed by Jimmy T. Murakami and produced by Roger Corman. The film, intended as a \"Magnificent Seven in outer space\", is based on the plots of The Magnificent Seven and Seven Samurai. The movie acknowledges its debt to Seven Samurai by calling the protagonist's homeworld Akir and its inhabitants the Akira.</p><p>The plot of Seven Samurai was re-worked for The Seven Magnificent Gladiators (1983), an Italian sword-and-sandal film.</p><p>The steampunk anime series Samurai 7 (2004) is based on Seven Samurai.</p><p>Some film critics have noted similarities between Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998) and Seven Samurai.</p><p>Several elements from The Seven Samurai are also argued to have been adapted for Star Wars (1977). The Clone Wars episode \"Bounty Hunters\" (2008) pays direct homage to Akira Kurosawa by adapting the film's plot, as does The Mandalorian episode Chapter 4: Sanctuary (2019).</p><p>Seven Swords (2005), a Hong Kong wuxia film produced and directed by Tsui Hark has a plot revolving around seven warriors helping villagers to defend against mercenaries, in homage to Seven Samurai.</p><p>There have been pachinko machines based on Seven Samurai in Japan. Seven Samurai pachinko machines have sold 94,000 units in Japan as of March 2018, grossing approximately $470 million.</p><br/><h3>Awards and nominations</h3><ul><li>Winner - Silver Lion - Akira Kurosawa</li><li>Nominated - Golden Lion - Akira Kurosawa</li></ul><ul><li>Winner - Best Supporting Actor - Seiji Miyaguchi</li></ul><ul><li>Nominated - BAFTA Award for Best Film</li><li>Nominated - BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor - Toshiro Mifune</li><li>Nominated - BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor - Takashi Shimura</li></ul><ul><li>Nominated - Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White - So Matsuyama</li><li>Nominated - Best Costume Design, Black-and-White - Kohei Ezaki</li></ul><ul><li>Winner - Best Foreign Director - Akira Kurosawa</li><li>Winner - Best Foreign Actor - Takashi Shimura</li></ul><br/>"
