One of her students asks her about a painting of hers, which Marianne calls Portrait de la jeune fille en feu.\r\nYears previously, Marianne arrives on a distant island in Brittany. She has been commissioned to paint a portrait of a young woman named H\u00e9lo\u00efse, who is to be married off to a Milanese nobleman. Marianne is informed that H\u00e9lo\u00efse has previously refused to pose for portraits, as she does not want to be married; she had been living in a convent before the suicide of her older sister necessitated her return and her betrothal. Marianne acts as H\u00e9lo\u00efse's hired companion to be able to paint her in secret, and accompanies her on daily walks along the rugged coastline to memorize H\u00e9lo\u00efse's features.\r\nMarianne finishes the portrait, but finds herself unable to betray H\u00e9lo\u00efse's trust and reveals her true reason for arriving. After H\u00e9lo\u00efse criticises the painting, which does not seem to portray her true nature, Marianne destroys the work. H\u00e9lo\u00efse's mother is shocked to hear that H\u00e9lo\u00efse is willing to pose for Marianne over the next few days, while her mother visits Italy. H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne's bond grows during the mother's absence. One evening, they read the story of Orpheus and Eurydice and debate the true reason why Orpheus turns around to look at his wife, causing her to be returned to the underworld. The pair help Sophie, a maid, have an abortion, and the three go to a bonfire gathering where women sing, during which H\u00e9lo\u00efse's dress briefly catches fire. Meanwhile, Marianne is haunted throughout the house by visions of H\u00e9lo\u00efse in a wedding dress.\r\nThe next day, Marianne and H\u00e9lo\u00efse go to a cave and share their first kiss and make love later that night. Over the next few days, their romance grows stronger. However, it is cut short by the inevitable return of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's mother, who approves of the now completed portrait. The evening before her departure, Marianne sketches a drawing of H\u00e9lo\u00efse to remember her, and H\u00e9lo\u00efse asks Marianne to draw a sketch of herself on page 28 of her book. The next morning Marianne bids farewell, and as she is about to leave the house she hears H\u00e9lo\u00efse say, \"Turn around\". She turns and sees H\u00e9lo\u00efse in her wedding dress, appearing exactly as she did in the visions that haunted Marianne earlier.\r\nIn the present, Marianne reveals that she saw H\u00e9lo\u00efse twice again. The first time was in the form of a portrait at an art exhibition where H\u00e9lo\u00efse, with a child beside her, is holding a book showing only page number 28\u2014secretly acknowledging the memory of Marianne through the memento that H\u00e9lo\u00efse requested from her. The second time was at a concert where H\u00e9lo\u00efse sat in a theater balcony across from Marianne.

'Portrait of the Young Lady on Fire') is a 2019 French historical romantic drama film written and directed by C\u00e9line Sciamma, starring No\u00e9mie Merlant and Ad\u00e8le Haenel. Set in France in the late 18th century, the film tells the story of a forbidden affair between an aristocrat and a painter commissioned to paint her portrait.</p><p>Portrait of a Lady on Fire was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The film won the Queer Palm at Cannes, becoming the first film directed by a woman to win the award. Sciamma also won the award for Best Screenplay at Cannes. The film was theatrically released in France on 18 September 2019.</p><p>It was nominated for Independent Spirit Awards, Critics' Choice Awards and Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and was chosen by the National Board of Review as Top Five Foreign Language Films of 2019.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>At the end of the eighteenth century, Marianne, a young painter, is teaching painting. One of her students asks her about a painting of hers, which Marianne calls Portrait de la jeune fille en feu.</p><p>Years previously, Marianne arrives on a distant island in Brittany. She has been commissioned to paint a portrait of a young woman named H\u00e9lo\u00efse, who is to be married off to a Milanese nobleman. Marianne is informed that H\u00e9lo\u00efse has previously refused to pose for portraits, as she does not want to be married; she had been living in a convent before the suicide of her older sister necessitated her return and her betrothal. Marianne acts as H\u00e9lo\u00efse's hired companion to be able to paint her in secret, and accompanies her on daily walks along the rugged coastline to memorize H\u00e9lo\u00efse's features.</p><p>Marianne finishes the portrait, but finds herself unable to betray H\u00e9lo\u00efse's trust and reveals her true reason for arriving. After H\u00e9lo\u00efse criticises the painting, which does not seem to portray her true nature, Marianne destroys the work. H\u00e9lo\u00efse's mother is shocked to hear that H\u00e9lo\u00efse is willing to pose for Marianne over the next few days, while her mother visits Italy. H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne's bond grows during the mother's absence. One evening, they read the story of Orpheus and Eurydice and debate the true reason why Orpheus turns around to look at his wife, causing her to be returned to the underworld. The pair help Sophie, a maid, have an abortion, and the three go to a bonfire gathering where women sing, during which H\u00e9lo\u00efse's dress briefly catches fire. Meanwhile, Marianne is haunted throughout the house by visions of H\u00e9lo\u00efse in a wedding dress.</p><p>The next day, Marianne and H\u00e9lo\u00efse go to a cave and share their first kiss and make love later that night. Over the next few days, their romance grows stronger. However, it is cut short by the inevitable return of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's mother, who approves of the now completed portrait. The evening before her departure, Marianne sketches a drawing of H\u00e9lo\u00efse to remember her, and H\u00e9lo\u00efse asks Marianne to draw a sketch of herself on page 28 of her book. The next morning Marianne bids farewell, and as she is about to leave the house she hears H\u00e9lo\u00efse say, \"Turn around\". She turns and sees H\u00e9lo\u00efse in her wedding dress, appearing exactly as she did in the visions that haunted Marianne earlier.</p><p>In the present, Marianne reveals that she saw H\u00e9lo\u00efse twice again. The first time was in the form of a portrait at an art exhibition where H\u00e9lo\u00efse, with a child beside her, is holding a book showing only page number 28\u2014secretly acknowledging the memory of Marianne through the memento that H\u00e9lo\u00efse requested from her.
