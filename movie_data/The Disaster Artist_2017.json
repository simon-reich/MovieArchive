Franco also received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and the film earned a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 90th Academy Awards.\r\nPlot\r\nIn San Francisco in 1998, 19-year-old Greg Sestero befriends Tommy Wiseau in acting classes with Jean Shelton after Tommy gives a protracted and bizarre performance of a scene from A Streetcar Named Desire. Greg is impressed by his fearlessness, although Tommy exhibits unusual habits and mannerisms; for instance, he insists on being from New Orleans despite having a European accent. On Tommy's suggestion, they move to Los Angeles to pursue acting careers. Greg discovers that Tommy can afford apartments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, but he will not discuss his personal life or the source of his wealth. Greg signs with talent agent Iris Burton and regularly attends auditions, while Tommy is consistently rejected by agencies, acting teachers, casting directors and producers. Greg begins dating Amber, whom he meets at her job at a nightclub, and Tommy grows jealous, believing that their relationship is sabotaging his with Greg; as he continuously fails to find work, he becomes disheartened. As Greg's auditions also dry up, he shares his frustrations with Tommy, who decides to make a film for them to star in.\r\nTommy writes the screenplay for The Room, a melodrama about a love triangle between banker Johnny (played by Tommy), his fianc\u00e9e Lisa, and his best friend Mark. Greg reluctantly accepts the role of Mark and a line producer credit. They rent out the Burns & Sawyer production house; Tommy insists on buying all the production equipment and shooting the film on 35mm film and HD Digital simultaneously, costly and unnecessary measures. The employees introduce Tommy to Raphael Smadja and Sandy Schklair, who work as his cinematographer and script supervisor, respectively. Actress Juliette Danielle is cast as Lisa. Production starts smoothly, but Tommy is difficult to work with. He forgets his lines, arrives late, and refuses to supply his crew with basic needs such as drinking water and air conditioning. With no one receiving a full script, the cast and crew are baffled by the film's nonsensical plot and Tommy's inexplicable directorial and acting choices. During preparation for a sex scene, Tommy refuses to film on a closed set and humiliates Juliette by pointing out the acne on her shoulder to the entire crew. Having filmed extensive behind-the-scenes footage, Tommy reveals that he knows everybody hates him and believes that nobody, including Greg, supports his vision.\r\nGreg and Amber run into Malcolm in the Middle star Bryan Cranston, who invites Greg to fill in for a small part in a Malcolm episode. The part requires a beard; as Greg is due to shave his beard for The Room, he begs Tommy to postpone shooting, but Tommy refuses. On the last day of shooting, Greg accuses Tommy of selfishness and duplicity throughout their friendship and questions his real age and origins. The two fight before Greg storms off. Eight months pass; by June 2003, Amber and Greg have split up and Greg is working in theatre. Tommy invites Greg to the premiere of The Room; to Greg's surprise, the entire cast and crew attend. The audience reacts with laughter, as Tommy's poor performance, script, and filmmaking techniques become immediately apparent. A devastated Tommy storms out, but Greg comforts him, telling him that they have delighted the audience. With renewed optimism, Tommy returns to the theater as The Room ends and takes credit for his \"comedic\" film. Inviting Greg onstage to thank him, the pair receive a standing ovation.\r\nIn a post-credits scene, Tommy meets Henry, a partygoer who offers to hang out. Tommy refuses, oblivious to the similarities in their accents and mannerisms.\r\nCast\r\nDave Franco as Greg Sestero, the line producer and actor who portrays Mark in The Room\r\nJames Franco as Tommy Wiseau, the writer, director, producer, executive producer and actor who portrays Johnny in The Room\r\nSeth Rogen as Sandy Schklair, the script supervisor and de facto first assistant director of The Room\r\nAri Graynor as Juliette Danielle, the actress who portrays Lisa in The Room\r\nAlison Brie as Amber, Greg Sestero's girlfriend\r\nJacki Weaver as Carolyn Minnott, the actress who portrays Claudette in The Room\r\nPaul Scheer as Raphael Smadja, the first DP of The Room\r\nZac Efron as Dan Janjigian, the actor who portrays Chris-R in The Room\r\nJosh Hutcherson as Philip Haldiman, the actor who portrays Denny in The Room\r\nJune Diane Raphael as Robyn Paris, the actress who portrays Michelle in The Room\r\nMegan Mullally as Mrs. Sestero, Greg Sestero's mother\r\nJason Mantzoukas as Peter Anway, the representative of Birns and Sawyer\r\nAndrew Santino as Scott Holmes, the actor who portrays Mike in The Room\r\nNathan Fielder as Kyle Vogt, the actor who portrays Peter in The Room\r\nSharon Stone as Iris Burton, Greg Sestero's agent\r\nMelanie Griffith as Jean Shelton, the teacher of an acting class attended by Wiseau and Sestero\r\nHannibal Buress as Bill Meurer, the owner of Birns and Sawyer, a stage rented by Wiseau\r\nBob Odenkirk as Wiseau's method acting teacher\r\nJudd Apatow as Justin Hammer, a film producer accosted by Wiseau\r\nKristen Bell, Ike Barinholtz, Adam Scott, Kevin Smith, Keegan-Michael Key, Lizzy Caplan, Danny McBride, Zach Braff and J.

Other roles include John Early as Burton's executive assistant Chris Snyder, Joe Mande as DP Todd Barron, Charlyne Yi as costume designer Safowa Bright-Asare, Kelly Oxford as makeup artist Amy Von Brock, Tom Franco as Karl, Zoey Deutch as Tommy's acting classmate Bobbi, Sugar Lyn Beard as an actress auditioning for Lisa, Brian Huskey as a bank teller, Randall Park as Greg's acting classmate Rob, Jerrod Carmichael as an actor friend of Greg's, Casey Wilson as a casting director, Lauren Ash as the florist in The Room's \"Hi, doggie\" sequence, and Angelyne as herself. Bryan Cranston makes an uncredited appearance as himself. Greg Sestero appears as an assistant casting director, while Tommy Wiseau appears in a post-credits scene as a character named Henry.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nIn February 2014, Seth Rogen's production company Point Grey Pictures announced it had acquired the book and film rights to The Disaster Artist. James Franco was set to direct and play Wiseau, and his brother Dave Franco was cast as Sestero. James Franco stated The Disaster Artist was \"a combination of Boogie Nights and The Master.\" According to Franco, Wiseau initially had hoped Johnny Depp would play him. In April 2016, the title was reported to have changed from The Disaster Artist to The Masterpiece, though The Disaster Artist was confirmed as the official title when the film's SXSW premiere was announced.\r\nCasting\r\nIn June 2014, James Franco's younger brother, Dave Franco, informally announced at a midnight showing of The Room that he had been cast in the co-starring role of Greg Sestero. Wiseau praised the decision in a Q&A session. The film is the first collaboration of James and brother Dave, as the younger Franco has said that he had sought different projects deliberately, specifying in an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, \"I didn't want people to think I was riding his coattails.\" As New Line Cinema sought to acquire The Disaster Artist in October 2015, one of the film's producers, and frequent Franco collaborator, Seth Rogen, was in negotiations to play The Room's script supervisor, Sandy Schklair. The remainder of the principal cast were revealed in the days prior to the beginning of filming, in early December 2015: Josh Hutcherson plays Philip Haldiman, Ari Graynor as Juliette Danielle, Jacki Weaver as Carolyn Minnott, Hannibal Buress as Bill Meur, Andrew Santino as Scott Holmes, and Zac Efron as Dan Janjigian. Dave Franco's wife, Alison Brie, joined the cast in the role of Sestero's then-girlfriend, Amber, and Sharon Stone was later announced to have been cast as Hollywood talent agent Iris Burton. Sestero stated in January 2016 that Bryan Cranston had been cast in the film in an undisclosed role. In November 2016, he was revealed to be playing himself during his time working on Malcolm in the Middle.\r\nMusic\r\nCliff Eidelman and Dave Porter composed the film's score.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began on December 8, 2015, in Los Angeles, and ended on January 28, 2016.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film had its premiere, in a work-in-progress form, at South by Southwest on March 12, 2017. In May 2017, A24 acquired distribution rights to the film, and set the film for a limited release on December 1, 2017, before a wide release on December 8. Warner Bros. Pictures distributes the film internationally, and it received an IMAX release in selected areas as well.\r\nMarketing\r\nOn October 25, 2017, A24 mounted a billboard on Highland Avenue in Los Angeles that replicated the original The Room billboard that Wiseau kept up from 2003 to 2008.\r\nHome media\r\nIt was released on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on March 13, 2018. As of February 20, 2019, its estimated US home media sales were $1,288,213.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe Disaster Artist grossed $21.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $8.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $29.8 million, against a production budget of $10 million.\r\nThe film grossed $1.2 million from 19 theaters in its limited opening weekend, finishing 12th at the box office and averaging $64,254 per venue, one of the highest averages of 2017. The film had its wide expansion the following week, alongside the opening of Just Getting Started, and was projected to gross around $5 million from 840 theaters over the weekend. It ended up making $6.4 million, finishing 4th at the box office. The following week, despite being added to 170 additional theaters, the film dropped a more-than-expected 57% to $2.7 million, finishing 8th. In its third weekend of wide release it made $884,576 ($1.2 million over the four day Christmas frame), dropping to 17th.\r\nCritical response\r\nThe Disaster Artist received a standing ovation at its initial screening at South by Southwest. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 336 reviews and an average rating of 7.79/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Oh, hai Mark. The Disaster Artist is a surprisingly poignant and charming movie-about-a-movie that explores the creative process with unexpected delicacy.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 81% overall positive score and a 66% \"definite recommend\".\r\nErik Childress of The Playlist dubbed James Franco's performance his \"best... since his Oscar-nominated turn in 127 Hours.\" Further, he wrote that \"as a director it is nice to finally see him embrace the comfort zone of comedy with enough cameos to rival Robert Altman's The Player.\" Peter Debruge of Variety said it had a \"genuine capacity to delight, whether or not the audiences in question have seen The Room.\"\r\nWriting for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying: \"As a director, Franco succeeds beautifully at bringing coherence to chaos, a word that accurately describes the making of this modern midnight-movie phenomenon. Do you need to see The Room to appreciate The Disaster Artist? Not really.\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"a hilarious, heartening celebration of failure\".\r\nManohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that it is \"a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, writing that the film brings up unanswered questions, and that it \"has room for improvement\". Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a rating of \"C\", calling it a \"lousy tribute\" and asking, \"will anyone who hasn't seen The Room actually be able to piece together a sense of this Z-grade sensation from watching The Disaster Artist?\"\r\nAccolades",

Greg reluctantly accepts the role of Mark and a line producer credit. They rent out the Burns & Sawyer production house; Tommy insists on buying all the production equipment and shooting the film on 35mm film and HD Digital simultaneously, costly and unnecessary measures. The employees introduce Tommy to Raphael Smadja and Sandy Schklair, who work as his cinematographer and script supervisor, respectively. Actress Juliette Danielle is cast as Lisa. Production starts smoothly, but Tommy is difficult to work with. He forgets his lines, arrives late, and refuses to supply his crew with basic needs such as drinking water and air conditioning. With no one receiving a full script, the cast and crew are baffled by the film's nonsensical plot and Tommy's inexplicable directorial and acting choices. During preparation for a sex scene, Tommy refuses to film on a closed set and humiliates Juliette by pointing out the acne on her shoulder to the entire crew. Having filmed extensive behind-the-scenes footage, Tommy reveals that he knows everybody hates him and believes that nobody, including Greg, supports his vision.</p><p>Greg and Amber run into Malcolm in the Middle star Bryan Cranston, who invites Greg to fill in for a small part in a Malcolm episode. The part requires a beard; as Greg is due to shave his beard for The Room, he begs Tommy to postpone shooting, but Tommy refuses. On the last day of shooting, Greg accuses Tommy of selfishness and duplicity throughout their friendship and questions his real age and origins. The two fight before Greg storms off. Eight months pass; by June 2003, Amber and Greg have split up and Greg is working in theatre. Tommy invites Greg to the premiere of The Room; to Greg's surprise, the entire cast and crew attend. The audience reacts with laughter, as Tommy's poor performance, script, and filmmaking techniques become immediately apparent. A devastated Tommy storms out, but Greg comforts him, telling him that they have delighted the audience. With renewed optimism, Tommy returns to the theater as The Room ends and takes credit for his \"comedic\" film. Inviting Greg onstage to thank him, the pair receive a standing ovation.</p><p>In a post-credits scene, Tommy meets Henry, a partygoer who offers to hang out. Tommy refuses, oblivious to the similarities in their accents and mannerisms.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Dave Franco as Greg Sestero, the line producer and actor who portrays Mark in The Room</li><li>James Franco as Tommy Wiseau, the writer, director, producer, executive producer and actor who portrays Johnny in The Room</li><li>Seth Rogen as Sandy Schklair, the script supervisor and de facto first assistant director of The Room</li><li>Ari Graynor as Juliette Danielle, the actress who portrays Lisa in The Room</li><li>Alison Brie as Amber, Greg Sestero's girlfriend</li><li>Jacki Weaver as Carolyn Minnott, the actress who portrays Claudette in The Room</li><li>Paul Scheer as Raphael Smadja, the first DP of The Room</li><li>Zac Efron as Dan Janjigian, the actor who portrays Chris-R in The Room</li><li>Josh Hutcherson as Philip Haldiman, the actor who portrays Denny in The Room</li><li>June Diane Raphael as Robyn Paris, the actress who portrays Michelle in The Room</li><li>Megan Mullally as Mrs. Sestero, Greg Sestero's mother</li><li>Jason Mantzoukas as Peter Anway, the representative of Birns and Sawyer</li><li>Andrew Santino as Scott Holmes, the actor who portrays Mike in The Room</li><li>Nathan Fielder as Kyle Vogt, the actor who portrays Peter in The Room</li><li>Sharon Stone as Iris Burton, Greg Sestero's agent</li><li>Melanie Griffith as Jean Shelton, the teacher of an acting class attended by Wiseau and Sestero</li><li>Hannibal Buress as Bill Meurer, the owner of Birns and Sawyer, a stage rented by Wiseau</li><li>Bob Odenkirk as Wiseau's method acting teacher</li><li>Judd Apatow as Justin Hammer, a film producer accosted by Wiseau</li></ul><p>Kristen Bell, Ike Barinholtz, Adam Scott, Kevin Smith, Keegan-Michael Key, Lizzy Caplan, Danny McBride, Zach Braff and J.

James Franco was set to direct and play Wiseau, and his brother Dave Franco was cast as Sestero. James Franco stated The Disaster Artist was \"a combination of Boogie Nights and The Master.\" According to Franco, Wiseau initially had hoped Johnny Depp would play him. In April 2016, the title was reported to have changed from The Disaster Artist to The Masterpiece, though The Disaster Artist was confirmed as the official title when the film's SXSW premiere was announced.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>In June 2014, James Franco's younger brother, Dave Franco, informally announced at a midnight showing of The Room that he had been cast in the co-starring role of Greg Sestero. Wiseau praised the decision in a Q&A session. The film is the first collaboration of James and brother Dave, as the younger Franco has said that he had sought different projects deliberately, specifying in an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, \"I didn't want people to think I was riding his coattails.\" As New Line Cinema sought to acquire The Disaster Artist in October 2015, one of the film's producers, and frequent Franco collaborator, Seth Rogen, was in negotiations to play The Room's script supervisor, Sandy Schklair. The remainder of the principal cast were revealed in the days prior to the beginning of filming, in early December 2015: Josh Hutcherson plays Philip Haldiman, Ari Graynor as Juliette Danielle, Jacki Weaver as Carolyn Minnott, Hannibal Buress as Bill Meur, Andrew Santino as Scott Holmes, and Zac Efron as Dan Janjigian. Dave Franco's wife, Alison Brie, joined the cast in the role of Sestero's then-girlfriend, Amber, and Sharon Stone was later announced to have been cast as Hollywood talent agent Iris Burton. Sestero stated in January 2016 that Bryan Cranston had been cast in the film in an undisclosed role. In November 2016, he was revealed to be playing himself during his time working on Malcolm in the Middle.</p><h4>Music</h4><p>Cliff Eidelman and Dave Porter composed the film's score.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began on December 8, 2015, in Los Angeles, and ended on January 28, 2016.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>The film had its premiere, in a work-in-progress form, at South by Southwest on March 12, 2017.

Pictures distributes the film internationally, and it received an IMAX release in selected areas as well.</p><h4>Marketing</h4><p>On October 25, 2017, A24 mounted a billboard on Highland Avenue in Los Angeles that replicated the original The Room billboard that Wiseau kept up from 2003 to 2008.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>It was released on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on March 13, 2018.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 336 reviews and an average rating of 7.79/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Oh, hai Mark. The Disaster Artist is a surprisingly poignant and charming movie-about-a-movie that explores the creative process with unexpected delicacy.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 81% overall positive score and a 66% \"definite recommend\".</p><p>Erik Childress of The Playlist dubbed James Franco's performance his \"best... since his Oscar-nominated turn in 127 Hours.\" Further, he wrote that \"as a director it is nice to finally see him embrace the comfort zone of comedy with enough cameos to rival Robert Altman's The Player.\" Peter Debruge of Variety said it had a \"genuine capacity to delight, whether or not the audiences in question have seen The Room.\"</p><p>Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying: \"As a director, Franco succeeds beautifully at bringing coherence to chaos, a word that accurately describes the making of this modern midnight-movie phenomenon. Do you need to see The Room to appreciate The Disaster Artist? Not really.\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"a hilarious, heartening celebration of failure\".</p><p>Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that it is \"a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, writing that the film brings up unanswered questions, and that it \"has room for improvement\". Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a rating of \"C\", calling it a \"lousy tribute\" and asking, \"will anyone who hasn't seen The Room actually be able to piece together a sense of this Z-grade sensation from watching The Disaster Artist?\"</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient(s) and nominee(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"Reference\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Academy Awards</span></th><td><span>March 4, 2018</span></td><td><span>Best Adapted Screenplay</span></td><td><span>Scott Neustadter</span> and <span>Michael H.
