A British Film Institute poll ranked it one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.\r\nPlot\r\nThe self-loathing Charlie Kaufman is hired to write the screenplay adaptation of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief. He is struggling with anxiety, social phobia, depression, and low self esteem. His twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is freeloading there. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of Robert McKee's famous seminars.\r\nCharlie, who rejects formulaic scriptwriting, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of The Orchid Thief, but comes to feel that the book does not have a usable narrative and is impossible to turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of writer's block. Already well past his deadline with Columbia Pictures, and despairing of writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Too shy and socially awkward to speak with her upon arriving at her office, and after receiving the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clich\u00e9 psychological thriller called The 3 is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.\r\nDonald, who is confident socially, pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean, but finds her responses suspicious. He and Charlie follow Orlean to Florida, where she meets John Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of her book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid to manufacture a mind-altering drug that causes fascination. Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, Orlean decides that Charlie must be killed to prevent him from exposing her adultery and drug use.\r\nOrlean forces Charlie to drive to the swamp at gunpoint, where she intends to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Fleeing, Charlie and Donald drive off, but collide head-on with a ranger's truck. Donald is ejected through the windshield and dies moments later; Charlie is saved by the airbag. He runs into the swamp to hide but is spotted by Laroche. Laroche is killed by an alligator before he can kill Charlie.\r\nOrlean is arrested. Charlie reconciles with his mother as he calls to inform her of Donald's death. He later tells his former love interest, Amelia, that he loves her; she responds that she loves him too. Charlie finishes the script, which ends with him announcing in a voice-over that the script is finished and that for the first time he is filled with hope.\r\nCast\r\nNicolas Cage as Charlie Kaufman / Donald Kaufman\r\nMeryl Streep as Susan Orlean\r\nChris Cooper as John Laroche\r\nCara Seymour as Amelia Kavan\r\nBrian Cox as Robert McKee\r\nTilda Swinton as Valerie Thomas\r\nRon Livingston as Marty Bowen\r\nMaggie Gyllenhaal as Caroline Cunningham\r\nJudy Greer as Alice\r\nBob Yerkes as Charles Darwin\r\nJim Beaver as Ranger Tony\r\nLitefoot as Russell\r\nJay Tavare as Matthew Osceola\r\nDoug Jones as Augustus Margary\r\nPeter Jason as Defense Attorney\r\nTom Hanks was originally set for the double role of Charlie and Donald Kaufman. Variety reviewed the film as if Donald were a real person. Cage took the role for a $5 million salary, and wore a fatsuit during filming.\r\nStreep expressed strong interest in the role of Susan Orlean before being cast, and took a salary cut in recognition of the film's budget. John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but accepted it after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.\r\nLitefoot and Jay Tavare have small roles as Seminole. John Cusack, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, Lance Acord and Spike Jonze have uncredited cameos as themselves in scenes where Charlie Kaufman is on the set of Being John Malkovich, which he also wrote. Additional cameos include Doug Jones as explorer Augustus Margary, director Curtis Hanson as Orlean's husband, and David O. Russell as a New Yorker journalist.\r\nProduction\r\n\u2014Charlie Kaufman on writing the script\r\nThe idea to do a film adaptation of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief dates back to 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events and creating a fictional twin brother.

            "html": "<h2>Adaptation (film)</h2><p>Adaptation. is a 2002 American comedy-drama metafilm directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. The film stars Nicolas Cage as Kaufman and his fictional twin brother Donald, Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, and Chris Cooper as John Laroche, with Cara Seymour, Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton, Ron Livingston, and Maggie Gyllenhaal in supporting roles.</p><p>It is based both on Orlean's nonfiction book The Orchid Thief and Kaufman's experience attempting to adapt the book into a screenplay while suffering from writer's block. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.</p><p>Adaptation received awards at the 75th Academy Awards, 60th Golden Globe Awards, and 56th British Academy Film Awards, with Cooper winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Kaufman winning the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. A British Film Institute poll ranked it one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>The self-loathing Charlie Kaufman is hired to write the screenplay adaptation of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief. He is struggling with anxiety, social phobia, depression, and low self esteem. His twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is freeloading there. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of Robert McKee's famous seminars.</p><p>Charlie, who rejects formulaic scriptwriting, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of The Orchid Thief, but comes to feel that the book does not have a usable narrative and is impossible to turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of writer's block. Already well past his deadline with Columbia Pictures, and despairing of writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Too shy and socially awkward to speak with her upon arriving at her office, and after receiving the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clich\u00e9 psychological thriller called The 3 is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.</p><p>Donald, who is confident socially, pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean, but finds her responses suspicious. He and Charlie follow Orlean to Florida, where she meets John Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of her book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid to manufacture a mind-altering drug that causes fascination. Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, Orlean decides that Charlie must be killed to prevent him from exposing her adultery and drug use.</p><p>Orlean forces Charlie to drive to the swamp at gunpoint, where she intends to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Fleeing, Charlie and Donald drive off, but collide head-on with a ranger's truck. Donald is ejected through the windshield and dies moments later; Charlie is saved by the airbag. He runs into the swamp to hide but is spotted by Laroche. Laroche is killed by an alligator before he can kill Charlie.</p><p>Orlean is arrested. Charlie reconciles with his mother as he calls to inform her of Donald's death. He later tells his former love interest, Amelia, that he loves her; she responds that she loves him too. Charlie finishes the script, which ends with him announcing in a voice-over that the script is finished and that for the first time he is filled with hope.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Nicolas Cage as Charlie Kaufman / Donald Kaufman</li><li>Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean</li><li>Chris Cooper as John Laroche</li><li>Cara Seymour as Amelia Kavan</li><li>Brian Cox as Robert McKee</li><li>Tilda Swinton as Valerie Thomas</li><li>Ron Livingston as Marty Bowen</li><li>Maggie Gyllenhaal as Caroline Cunningham</li><li>Judy Greer as Alice</li><li>Bob Yerkes as Charles Darwin</li><li>Jim Beaver as Ranger Tony</li><li>Litefoot as Russell</li><li>Jay Tavare as Matthew Osceola</li><li>Doug Jones as Augustus Margary</li><li>Peter Jason as Defense Attorney</li></ul><p>Tom Hanks was originally set for the double role of Charlie and Donald Kaufman. Variety reviewed the film as if Donald were a real person. Cage took the role for a $5 million salary, and wore a fatsuit during filming.</p><p>Streep expressed strong interest in the role of Susan Orlean before being cast, and took a salary cut in recognition of the film's budget. John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but accepted it after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.</p><p>Litefoot and Jay Tavare have small roles as Seminole. John Cusack, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, Lance Acord and Spike Jonze have uncredited cameos as themselves in scenes where Charlie Kaufman is on the set of Being John Malkovich, which he also wrote. Additional cameos include Doug Jones as explorer Augustus Margary, director Curtis Hanson as Orlean's husband, and David O. Russell as a New Yorker journalist.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>\u2014Charlie Kaufman on writing the script</p><p>The idea to do a film adaptation of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief dates back to 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events and creating a fictional twin brother. He put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to him. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.</p><p>Kaufman has said,</p><blockquote>The idea of how to write the film didn't come to me until quite late. It was the only idea I had, I liked it, and I knew there was no way it would be approved if I pitched it. So I just wrote it and never told the people I was writing it for.
