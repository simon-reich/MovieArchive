His first night, he sees Yano in action, a master of judo, a more spiritual art, and he begs to be Yano's student. As the youth learns technique, he must also learn \"satori,\" the calm acceptance of Nature's law. If he can balance strength and control, then judo may become the training regimen for the city's police, Sanshiro can gain respect from an old teacher in a jujitsu school, and he can win the hand of Sayo, that teacher's daughter, who is also sought by jujitsu's finest master, the implacable Higaki, who vows to kill Sanshiro in a midnight fight on a windswept mountainside.",

His first attempts to find a suitable instructor fail until he finally finds a school with an accomplished judo master. Initially, Sanshiro is physically capable though he lacks any type of poise or reflection concerning his self-control and demeanor. After a grueling punishment set by his instructor to test his endurance by throwing him into a swamp overnight, Sanshiro begins to recognize the error in his ways and starts to appreciate that there is more to his life and to his art than simple muscle and brawn. Sanshiro becomes a leading student in his school.\r\nThe city is looking to employ one of the local martial arts schools to guide the training of its local police force, and the school of Sanshiro becomes a leading candidate along with its rival, the local school of jujutsu. In a scheduled competition between the two schools, Sanshiro is chosen to represent his school in a public match to determine which school is best to train the local police in the martial arts. The scheduled bout gets off to a slow start but Sanshiro soon comes into his own and begins executing devastating throws which cause internal physical damage to his opponent, who is forced to give up after the third time he is violently sent to the ground by Sanshiro.\r\nAfter the match, Sanshiro makes friends with his defeated opponent and becomes attracted to his daughter Sayo. Sayo is greeted as a local beauty in town and another jujutsu master, Higaki, becomes a rival to Sanshiro for her affections. When he challenges Sanshiro to a duel to the death, Sanshiro accepts and defeats him by inflicting permanent crippling damage to Higaki. After emerging victorious from his duel, Sanshiro prepares for his next assignment in Yokohama while being escorted on the local train by the young Sayo. He promises to return to her after he finishes his journey.\r\nCast\r\nSusumu Fujita as Sanshiro Sugata\r\nDenjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi as Sh\u014dgor\u014d Yano\r\nYukiko Todoroki as Sayo Murai\r\nRy\u016bnosuke Tsukigata as Gennosuke Higaki\r\nTakashi Shimura as Hansuke Murai\r\nRanko Hanai as Osumi Kodana\r\nSugisaku Aoyama as Tsunetami Iimura\r\nIchiro Sugai as Police Chief Michitsune Mishima\r\nYoshio Kosugi as Master Sabur\u014d Kodama\r\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d as Buddhist Priest\r\nMichisabur\u014d Segawa as Wada\r\nAkitake K\u014dno as Yoshima Dan\r\nSh\u014dji Kiyokawa as Y\u016bjir\u014d Toda\r\nKunio Mita as K\u014dhei Tsuzaki\r\nAkira Nakamura as Toranosuki Niiseki\r\nEisabur\u014d Sakauchi as Nemeto\r\nHajime Hikari as Torakichi\r\nProduction\r\nFollowing five years of second unit director work on films such as Uma and Roppa's Honeymoon, Kurosawa was finally given the go-ahead to direct his first film, even though he himself claimed that, in films like Uma, \"I had been so much in charge of production I had felt like the director\". After hearing of a new novel from the writer Tomita Tsuneo, Kurosawa decided the project was for him and asked film producer Iwao Mori to buy the rights for him.\r\nAccording to Japanese cinema scholar Donald Richie, the reason Kurosawa was allowed to direct the film was because he had had two film scripts printed, including one of which had won the education minister's prize. However, his work was too far away from the government requirements for a wartime film. Tomita's novel, on the other hand, was considered \"safe\", dealing, as it did, with a Japanese subject such as the martial rivalry between judo and jujitsu, was a period piece, and was a popularist subject. Kurosawa deliberately went out to make a \"movie-like movie\", as he knew he would not be able to insert any particularly didactic qualities in the film.\r\nAfter the initial release, Japanese censors trimmed the film by 17 minutes. This footage was never recovered; however, the original script with the missing material still exists. The 1952 re-release (from which the 2009 Criterion DVD is made) opens with (translated from the original Japanese text):\r\n\"This film has been modified from the original version of Akira Kurosawa's debut film, which opened in 1943, without consulting the director or the production staff. 1,845 feet of footage was cut in 1944 to comply with the government's wartime entertainment policies.\"\r\nPaul Anderer emphasized Kurosawa's attention to the character of Gennosuke Higaki in the film. Higaki, who was created by Tsuneo Tomita for the novel taking inspiration from real life jujutsu master Mataemon Tanabe, is made in the film its central villain. Anderer stated:\r\n\"Kurosawa would later call Higaki his Mephistopheles and insist that he is the most interesting character in this film. Given the heightened drama of every scene he invades, the visual association between him and the shadow, as well as the sound of his voice -- cued as it is to the raging wind -- Higaki does spur Kurosawa to deviate from the path of a conventional wartime 'spiritist' film. The director's focus shifts away; from a wholesome story of a guileless youth, perfecting his skill along with his pure Japanese heart. He stays strangely fixed on Higaki and conveys an unmistakable sympathy for the devil, no matter the moral consequence.\"\r\nThemes\r\nThe central theme of the film is the education and initiation of Sugata and the way in which, whilst learning the ways of Judo, he also learns about himself. The film's central scene concerning this theme is when, after being accosted by Yano for getting involved in a streetfight, Sugata leaps into the cold waters near Yano's temple and stays there in order to show his master his dedication, and the fact that he is neither afraid to live nor to die.\r\nReception\r\nAlthough received well enough in wartime Japan to warrant a sequel, the film received a conventional review from Dennis Schwartz writing for \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" who stated: \"The coming-of-age story didn't do much for me. It was a conventional film that always felt like something was missing, as the film suffers from poor pacing and huge gaps in its story line that keep things unnecessarily jumbled; also, the romantic tale was so bland that the lovers might just as well have been planning to meet for a chess game at the end rather than to resume their intended romance.\"\r\nRemakes\r\nSanshiro Sugata has been remade five times since it was initially released, although these versions are even harder to find in the west than the original. The 1955 and 1965 versions share the script of the original versions, whereas the subsequent three releases are all based on the novel rather than Kurosawa's screenplay.\r\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1955) - Directed by Shigeo Tanaka\r\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1965) - Directed by Seiichir\u014d Uchikawa\r\nNinky\u014d Yawara Ichidai (1966) - Directed by Sadao Nakajima\r\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1970) - Directed by Kunio Watanabe\r\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1977) - Directed by Kihachi Okamoto",

After hearing of a new novel from the writer Tomita Tsuneo, Kurosawa decided the project was for him and asked film producer Iwao Mori to buy the rights for him.</p><p>According to Japanese cinema scholar Donald Richie, the reason Kurosawa was allowed to direct the film was because he had had two film scripts printed, including one of which had won the education minister's prize. However, his work was too far away from the government requirements for a wartime film. Tomita's novel, on the other hand, was considered \"safe\", dealing, as it did, with a Japanese subject such as the martial rivalry between judo and jujitsu, was a period piece, and was a popularist subject. Kurosawa deliberately went out to make a \"movie-like movie\", as he knew he would not be able to insert any particularly didactic qualities in the film.</p><p>After the initial release, Japanese censors trimmed the film by 17 minutes. This footage was never recovered; however, the original script with the missing material still exists. The 1952 re-release (from which the 2009 Criterion DVD is made) opens with (translated from the original Japanese text):</p><blockquote>\"This film has been modified from the original version of Akira Kurosawa's debut film, which opened in 1943, without consulting the director or the production staff. 1,845 feet of footage was cut in 1944 to comply with the government's wartime entertainment policies.\"</blockquote><p>Paul Anderer emphasized Kurosawa's attention to the character of Gennosuke Higaki in the film. Higaki, who was created by Tsuneo Tomita for the novel taking inspiration from real life jujutsu master Mataemon Tanabe, is made in the film its central villain. Anderer stated:</p><blockquote>\"Kurosawa would later call Higaki his Mephistopheles and insist that he is the most interesting character in this film. Given the heightened drama of every scene he invades, the visual association between him and the shadow, as well as the sound of his voice -- cued as it is to the raging wind -- Higaki does spur Kurosawa to deviate from the path of a conventional wartime 'spiritist' film. The director's focus shifts away; from a wholesome story of a guileless youth, perfecting his skill along with his pure Japanese heart. He stays strangely fixed on Higaki and conveys an unmistakable sympathy for the devil, no matter the moral consequence.\"</blockquote><br/><h3>Themes</h3><p>The central theme of the film is the education and initiation of Sugata and the way in which, whilst learning the ways of Judo, he also learns about himself. The film's central scene concerning this theme is when, after being accosted by Yano for getting involved in a streetfight, Sugata leaps into the cold waters near Yano's temple and stays there in order to show his master his dedication, and the fact that he is neither afraid to live nor to die.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>Although received well enough in wartime Japan to warrant a sequel, the film received a conventional review from Dennis Schwartz writing for \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" who stated: \"The coming-of-age story didn't do much for me. It was a conventional film that always felt like something was missing, as the film suffers from poor pacing and huge gaps in its story line that keep things unnecessarily jumbled; also, the romantic tale was so bland that the lovers might just as well have been planning to meet for a chess game at the end rather than to resume their intended romance.\"</p><br/><h3>Remakes</h3><p>Sanshiro Sugata has been remade five times since it was initially released, although these versions are even harder to find in the west than the original. The 1955 and 1965 versions share the script of the original versions, whereas the subsequent three releases are all based on the novel rather than Kurosawa's screenplay.</p><ul><li>Sugata Sanshir\u014d (1955) - Directed by Shigeo Tanaka</li><li>Sugata Sanshir\u014d (1965) - Directed by Seiichir\u014d Uchikawa</li><li>Ninky\u014d Yawara Ichidai (1966) - Directed by Sadao Nakajima</li><li>Sugata Sanshir\u014d (1970) - Directed by Kunio Watanabe</li><li>Sugata Sanshir\u014d (1977) - Directed by Kihachi Okamoto</li></ul><br/>"
