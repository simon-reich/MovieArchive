The final film in the trilogy, The Godfather Part III, was released in 1990.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1958, during his son's First Communion party at Lake Tahoe, Michael has a series of meetings in his role as the don of the Corleone crime family. Frank Pentangeli, a Corleone capo, is dismayed that Michael refuses to help defend his territory against the Rosato brothers, who work for Michael's business partner Hyman Roth. That night, Michael leaves Nevada after surviving an assassination attempt at his home.\r\nMichael suspects Roth planned the assassination, but meets him in Miami and feigns ignorance. In New York City, Pentangeli attempts to maintain Michael's fa\u00e7ade by making peace with the Rosato family but they attempt to kill him. Roth, Michael, and several of their partners travel to Havana to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of Fulgencio Batista. Michael becomes reluctant after reconsidering the viability of the ongoing Cuban Revolution. On New Year's Eve, he attempts to have Roth and Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola, killed, but Roth survives when Michael's bodyguard is discovered and shot by police. Michael discovers that his brother Fredo betrayed him after Fredo inadvertently reveals that he knows Ola after claiming they had never met. Batista abruptly abdicates due to rebel advances. During the ensuing chaos, Michael, Fredo, and Roth separately escape to the United States. Back home, Michael learns that his wife Kay has miscarried.\r\nIn Washington, D.C., a Senate committee on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family. Having survived the earlier attempt on his life, Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael, who he believes had double-crossed him, and is placed under witness protection.\r\nOn returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he has felt resentful for being disregarded; he had helped Roth, expecting something in return. He claims to be ignorant of the plot on Michael's life. He informs Michael that the Senate lawyer is on Roth\u2019s payroll. Michael responds by disowning Fredo and tells his capo that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is alive. Michael is unable to reach the heavily guarded Pentangeli, so he sends for Pentangeli's brother from Sicily, resulting in Pentangeli renouncing his previous statement; the hearing dissolves in an uproar.\r\nKay reveals to Michael that she actually had an abortion, not a miscarriage and that she intends to remove their children from Michael's criminal life. Outraged, Michael strikes Kay, banishes her from the family, and takes custody of the children.\r\nMichael's mother dies. At the funeral, Michael appears to forgive Fredo.\r\nRoth is refused asylum and denied entry to Israel. He is forced to return to the United States. Over the dissent of consigliere Tom Hagen, capo Rocco Lampone is ordered by Michael to assassinate Roth; posing as a journalist at Miami International Airport, Lampone shoots Roth dead before federal agents kill him. At the witness protection compound, Hagen reminds Pentangeli that failed plotters against the Roman Emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for. Pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub. Al Neri, acting on Michael's orders, assassinates Fredo out on the lake.\r\nMichael sits alone by the lake at the family compound.\r\nCast\r\nAl Pacino as Michael\r\nRobert Duvall as Tom Hagen\r\nDiane Keaton as Kay\r\nRobert De Niro as Vito Corleone\r\nJohn Cazale as Fredo Corleone\r\nTalia Shire as Connie Corleone\r\nLee Strasberg as Hyman Roth\r\nMichael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli\r\nG. D. Spradlin as Senator Pat Geary\r\nRichard Bright as Al Neri\r\nGastone Moschin as Fanucci\r\nTom Rosqui as Rocco Lampone\r\nB. Kirby, Jr. as Young Clemenza\r\nFrank Sivero as young Genco\r\nFrancesca De Sapio as Young Mama Corleone\r\nMorgana King as Mama Corleone\r\nMariana Hill as Deanna Corleone\r\nLeopoldo Trieste as Signor Roberto\r\nDominic Chianese as Johnny Ola\r\nAmerigo Tot as Michael's bodyguard\r\nTroy Donahue as Merle Johnson\r\nJohn Aprea as Young Tessio\r\nJoe Spinell as Willi Cicci\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nPuzo started writing a script for a sequel in December 1971, before The Godfather was even released; its initial title was The Death of Michael Corleone. Coppola's idea for the sequel would be to \"juxtapose the ascension of the family under Vito Corleone with the decline of the family under his son Michael...I had always wanted to write a screenplay that told the story of a father and a son at the same age. They were both in their thirties and I would integrate the two stories...In order not to merely make Godfather I over again, I gave Godfather II this double structure by extending the story in both the past and in the present.\"\r\nCoppola, in his director's commentary on The Godfather Part II, mentioned that the scenes depicting the Senate committee interrogation of Michael Corleone and Frank Pentangeli are based on the Joseph Valachi federal hearings and that Pentangeli is like a Valachi figure.\r\nThe film's original budget was $6 million but costs increased to over $11 million, with Variety's review claiming it was over $15 million.\r\nCasting\r\nCoppola offered James Cagney a part in the film, but he refused. James Caan agreed to reprise the role of Sonny in the birthday flashback sequence, demanding he be paid the same amount he received for the entire previous film for the single scene in Part II, which he received.\r\nSeveral actors from the first film did not return for the sequel. Marlon Brando initially agreed to return for the birthday flashback sequence, but the actor, feeling mistreated by the board at Paramount, failed to show up for the single day's shooting. Coppola then rewrote the scene that same day. Richard S. Castellano, who portrayed Peter Clemenza in the first film, also declined to return, as he and the producers could not reach an agreement on his demands that he be allowed to write the character's dialogue in the film. The part in the plot originally intended for the latter-day Clemenza was then filled by the character of Frank Pentangeli, played by Michael V. Gazzo.\r\nTroy Donahue, in a small role as Connie's boyfriend, plays a character named Merle Johnson, which was his birth name.\r\nTwo actors who appear in the film played different character roles in other Godfather films: Carmine Caridi, who plays Carmine Rosato, also went on to play crime boss Albert Volpe in The Godfather Part III; Frank Sivero, who plays a young Genco Abbandando, appears as a bystander in The Godfather scene in which Sonny beats up Carlo for abusing Connie.\r\nAmong the actors depicting Senators in the hearing committee are film producer/director Roger Corman, writer/producer William Bowers, producer Phil Feldman, actor Peter Donat and science-fiction writer Richard Matheson.\r\nFilming\r\nThe Godfather Part II was shot between October 1, 1973 and June 19, 1974. The scenes that took place in Cuba were shot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Charles Bluhdorn, whose Gulf+Western conglomerate owned Paramount, felt strongly about developing the Dominican Republic as a movie-making site. Forza d'Agr\u00f2 was the Sicilian town featured in the film.\r\nUnlike with the first film, Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.\r\nProduction nearly ended before it began when Pacino's lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.\r\nCoppola discusses his decision to make this the first major U.S. motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title in the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the film's success began the common practice of numbered sequels.\r\nOnly three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced Part II a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michael's parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the film's narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening.\r\nIt was the last major American motion picture to have release prints made with Technicolor's dye imbibition process until the late 1990s.\r\nMusic\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nThe Godfather Part II premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974.\r\nHome media\r\nCoppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from The Godfather Part III and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title The Godfather Trilogy 1901\u20131980, had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set's bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\".\r\nThe Godfather DVD Collection was released on October 9, 2001 in a package that contained all three films\u2014each with a commentary track by Coppola\u2014and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 entitled The Godfather Family: A Look Inside and other miscellany about the film: the additional scenes originally contained in The Godfather Saga; Francis Coppola's Notebook (a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film); rehearsal footage; a promotional featurette from 1971; and video segments on Gordon Willis's cinematography, Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's music, the director, the locations and Mario Puzo's screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.\r\nThe restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for The Godfather Part III, when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was \"terrific\".\r\nThe Godfather: The Coppola Restoration\r\nAfter a careful restoration of the first two movies, The Godfather movies were released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 23, 2008, under the title The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration. The work was done by Robert A. Harris of Film Preserve. The Blu-ray Disc box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on Disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).\r\nOther extras are ported over from Paramount's 2001 DVD release. There are slight differences between the repurposed extras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, with the HD box having more content.\r\nVideo game\r\nThe video game based on the film was released in April 2009 by Electronic Arts.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe Godfather Part II did not surpass the original film commercially, but in the United States and Canada it grossed $47.5 million. It was Paramount Pictures' highest-grossing film of 1974 and was the seventh-highest-grossing picture in the United States that year. Re-released twice more since its original release, the film grossed between $48\u201388 million worldwide.\r\nCritical response\r\nInitial critical reception of The Godfather Part II was divided, with some dismissing the work and others declaring it superior to the first film. While its cinematography and acting were immediately acclaimed, many criticized it as overly slow-paced and convoluted. Vincent Canby viewed the film as \"stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. The plot defies any rational synopsis.\" Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic accused the story of featuring \"gaps and distentions.\" A mildly positive Roger Ebert awarded three stars out of four and wrote that the flashbacks \"give Coppola the greatest difficulty in maintaining his pace and narrative force. The story of Michael, told chronologically and without the other material, would have had really substantial impact, but Coppola prevents our complete involvement by breaking the tension.\" Though praising Pacino's performance and lauding Coppola as \"a master of mood, atmosphere, and period\", Ebert considered the chronological shifts of its narrative \"a structural weakness from which the film never recovers\". Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that it was at times \"as beautiful, as harrowing, and as exciting as the original. In fact, 'The Godfather, Part II' may be the second best gangster movie ever made. But it's not the same. Sequels can never be the same. It's like being forced to go to a funeral the second time\u2014the tears just don't flow as easily.\"\r\nThe film quickly became the subject of a critical re-evaluation. Whether considered separately or with its predecessor as one work, The Godfather Part II is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema. Many critics compare it favorably with the original \u2013 although it is rarely ranked higher on lists of \"greatest\" films. Roger Ebert retrospectively awarded it a full four stars in a second review and inducted the film into his Great Movies section, praising the work as \"grippingly written, directed with confidence and artistry, photographed by Gordon Willis in rich, warm tones.\" Michael Sragow's conclusion in his 2002 essay, selected for the National Film Registry web site, is that \"lthough \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" depict an American family's moral defeat, as a mammoth, pioneering work of art it remains a national creative triumph.\"\r\nThe Godfather Part II was featured on Sight & Sound's Director's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1992 and 2002. It ranked #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\", and #1 on TV Guide's 1998 list of the \"50 Greatest Movies of All Time on TV and Video\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 97% approval rating based on 79 critical reviews, with an average rating of 9.62/10. The consensus reads, \"Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nMany believe Pacino's performance in The Godfather Part II is his finest acting work, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized for awarding the Academy Award for Best Actor that year to Art Carney for his role in Harry and Tonto. It is now regarded as one of the greatest performances in film history. In 2006, Premiere issued its list of \"The 100 Greatest Performances of all Time\", putting Pacino's performance at #20. Later in 2009, Total Film issued \"The 150 Greatest Performances of All Time\", ranking Pacino's performance fourth place.\r\nAccolades\r\nThis film was the first sequel to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Godfather and The Godfather Part II remain the only original/sequel combination both to win Best Picture. Along with The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather Trilogy shares the distinction that all of its installments were nominated for Best Picture; additionally, The Godfather Part II and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are the only sequels to win Best Picture.\r\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\r\n1998: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies \u2013 #32\r\n2003: AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains: Michael Corleone \u2013 #11 Villain\r\nMichael Corleone \u2013 #11 Villain\r\n2005: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\" \u2013 #58 \"I know it was you, Fredo.

At the witness protection compound, Hagen reminds Pentangeli that failed plotters against the Roman Emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for. Pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub. Al Neri, acting on Michael's orders, assassinates Fredo out on the lake.</p><p>Michael sits alone by the lake at the family compound.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Al Pacino as Michael</li><li>Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen</li><li>Diane Keaton as Kay</li><li>Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone</li><li>John Cazale as Fredo Corleone</li><li>Talia Shire as Connie Corleone</li><li>Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth</li><li>Michael V.

Coppola's idea for the sequel would be to \"juxtapose the ascension of the family under Vito Corleone with the decline of the family under his son Michael...I had always wanted to write a screenplay that told the story of a father and a son at the same age. They were both in their thirties and I would integrate the two stories...In order not to merely make Godfather I over again, I gave Godfather II this double structure by extending the story in both the past and in the present.\"</p><p>Coppola, in his director's commentary on The Godfather Part II, mentioned that the scenes depicting the Senate committee interrogation of Michael Corleone and Frank Pentangeli are based on the Joseph Valachi federal hearings and that Pentangeli is like a Valachi figure.</p><p>The film's original budget was $6 million but costs increased to over $11 million, with Variety's review claiming it was over $15 million.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>Coppola offered James Cagney a part in the film, but he refused. James Caan agreed to reprise the role of Sonny in the birthday flashback sequence, demanding he be paid the same amount he received for the entire previous film for the single scene in Part II, which he received.</p><p>Several actors from the first film did not return for the sequel. Marlon Brando initially agreed to return for the birthday flashback sequence, but the actor, feeling mistreated by the board at Paramount, failed to show up for the single day's shooting. Coppola then rewrote the scene that same day. Richard S. Castellano, who portrayed Peter Clemenza in the first film, also declined to return, as he and the producers could not reach an agreement on his demands that he be allowed to write the character's dialogue in the film. The part in the plot originally intended for the latter-day Clemenza was then filled by the character of Frank Pentangeli, played by Michael V. Gazzo.</p><p>Troy Donahue, in a small role as Connie's boyfriend, plays a character named Merle Johnson, which was his birth name.</p><p>Two actors who appear in the film played different character roles in other Godfather films: Carmine Caridi, who plays Carmine Rosato, also went on to play crime boss Albert Volpe in The Godfather Part III; Frank Sivero, who plays a young Genco Abbandando, appears as a bystander in The Godfather scene in which Sonny beats up Carlo for abusing Connie.</p><p>Among the actors depicting Senators in the hearing committee are film producer/director Roger Corman, writer/producer William Bowers, producer Phil Feldman, actor Peter Donat and science-fiction writer Richard Matheson.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>The Godfather Part II was shot between October 1, 1973 and June 19, 1974. The scenes that took place in Cuba were shot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Charles Bluhdorn, whose Gulf+Western conglomerate owned Paramount, felt strongly about developing the Dominican Republic as a movie-making site. Forza d'Agr\u00f2 was the Sicilian town featured in the film.</p><p>Unlike with the first film, Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.</p><p>Production nearly ended before it began when Pacino's lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.</p><p>Coppola discusses his decision to make this the first major U.S. motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title in the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the film's success began the common practice of numbered sequels.</p><p>Only three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced Part II a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michael's parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the film's narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening.</p><p>It was the last major American motion picture to have release prints made with Technicolor's dye imbibition process until the late 1990s.</p><h4>Music</h4><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>The Godfather Part II premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Coppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from The Godfather Part III and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title The Godfather Trilogy 1901\u20131980, had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set's bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\".</p><p>The Godfather DVD Collection was released on October 9, 2001 in a package that contained all three films\u2014each with a commentary track by Coppola\u2014and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 entitled The Godfather Family: A Look Inside and other miscellany about the film: the additional scenes originally contained in The Godfather Saga; Francis Coppola's Notebook (a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film); rehearsal footage; a promotional featurette from 1971; and video segments on Gordon Willis's cinematography, Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's music, the director, the locations and Mario Puzo's screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.</p><p>The restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for The Godfather Part III, when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was \"terrific\".</p><h4>The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration</h4><p>After a careful restoration of the first two movies, The Godfather movies were released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 23, 2008, under the title The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration. The work was done by Robert A. Harris of Film Preserve. The Blu-ray Disc box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on Disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).</p><p>Other extras are ported over from Paramount's 2001 DVD release. There are slight differences between the repurposed extras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, with the HD box having more content.</p><h4>Video game</h4><p>The video game based on the film was released in April 2009 by Electronic Arts.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>The Godfather Part II did not surpass the original film commercially, but in the United States and Canada it grossed $47.5 million. It was Paramount Pictures' highest-grossing film of 1974 and was the seventh-highest-grossing picture in the United States that year. Re-released twice more since its original release, the film grossed between $48\u201388 million worldwide.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>Initial critical reception of The Godfather Part II was divided, with some dismissing the work and others declaring it superior to the first film. While its cinematography and acting were immediately acclaimed, many criticized it as overly slow-paced and convoluted. Vincent Canby viewed the film as \"stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. The plot defies any rational synopsis.\" Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic accused the story of featuring \"gaps and distentions.\" A mildly positive Roger Ebert awarded three stars out of four and wrote that the flashbacks \"give Coppola the greatest difficulty in maintaining his pace and narrative force. The story of Michael, told chronologically and without the other material, would have had really substantial impact, but Coppola prevents our complete involvement by breaking the tension.\" Though praising Pacino's performance and lauding Coppola as \"a master of mood, atmosphere, and period\", Ebert considered the chronological shifts of its narrative \"a structural weakness from which the film never recovers\". Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that it was at times \"as beautiful, as harrowing, and as exciting as the original. In fact, 'The Godfather, Part II' may be the second best gangster movie ever made. But it's not the same. Sequels can never be the same. It's like being forced to go to a funeral the second time\u2014the tears just don't flow as easily.\"</p><p>The film quickly became the subject of a critical re-evaluation. Whether considered separately or with its predecessor as one work, The Godfather Part II is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema. Many critics compare it favorably with the original \u2013 although it is rarely ranked higher on lists of \"greatest\" films. Roger Ebert retrospectively awarded it a full four stars in a second review and inducted the film into his Great Movies section, praising the work as \"grippingly written, directed with confidence and artistry, photographed by Gordon Willis in rich, warm tones.\" Michael Sragow's conclusion in his 2002 essay, selected for the National Film Registry web site, is that \"lthough \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" depict an American family's moral defeat, as a mammoth, pioneering work of art it remains a national creative triumph.\"</p><p>The Godfather Part II was featured on Sight & Sound's Director's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1992 and 2002. It ranked #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\", and #1 on TV Guide's 1998 list of the \"50 Greatest Movies of All Time on TV and Video\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 97% approval rating based on 79 critical reviews, with an average rating of 9.62/10. The consensus reads, \"Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Many believe Pacino's performance in The Godfather Part II is his finest acting work, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized for awarding the Academy Award for Best Actor that year to Art Carney for his role in Harry and Tonto. It is now regarded as one of the greatest performances in film history. In 2006, Premiere issued its list of \"The 100 Greatest Performances of all Time\", putting Pacino's performance at #20. Later in 2009, Total Film issued \"The 150 Greatest Performances of All Time\", ranking Pacino's performance fourth place.</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>This film was the first sequel to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Godfather and The Godfather Part II remain the only original/sequel combination both to win Best Picture. Along with The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather Trilogy shares the distinction that all of its installments were nominated for Best Picture; additionally, The Godfather Part II and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are the only sequels to win Best Picture.</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th>Award</th><th>Category</th><th>Nominee</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"11\"><span>47th Academy Awards</span></td><td><span>Best Picture</span></td><td><span>Francis Ford Coppola</span>, <span>Gray Frederickson</span>, <span>Fred Roos</span></td><td style=\"background: #99FF99; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2\">Won</td></tr><tr><td><span>Best Director</span></td><td>Francis Ford Coppola</td><td style=\"background: #99FF99; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2\">Won</td></tr><tr><td><span>Best Actor</span></td><td><span>Al Pacino</span></td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"><span>Best Supporting Actor</span></td><td><span>Robert De Niro</span></td><td style=\"background: #99FF99; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2\">Won</td></tr><tr><td><span>Michael V.
