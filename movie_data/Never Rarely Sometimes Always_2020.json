At the center, she takes a drug store test that confirms that she is 10 weeks pregnant. Though she immediately wants to terminate the pregnancy, she is given literature on adoption and is shown an anti-abortion video.\r\nAfter realizing that she is unable to get an abortion in Pennsylvania without parental consent, she tries to induce a miscarriage by swallowing pills and punching herself in the stomach. When those methods fail, she confides in her cousin, Skylar, that she is pregnant. Skylar steals cash from the grocery store where they work, and the two buy tickets to New York City.\r\nOn the bus they meet Jasper, a young man who is persistently interested in Skylar even though she tries to blow him off.\r\nAt the Planned Parenthood clinic, Autumn learns that the crisis pregnancy center lied to her about how far along she was and that she is actually 18 weeks pregnant. Though she is still able to get an abortion, she must go to a secondary clinic the following morning in order to have the abortion performed.\r\nAutumn and Skylar spend an uncomfortable night riding the subway and playing games at an arcade. The following morning at the clinic, Autumn learns that a second-trimester abortion is a two-day procedure and that paying for the abortion will wipe out most of her funds. The counselor also asks her a series of questions about her sexual partners which reveal that Autumn's partners have been physically and sexually abusive.\r\nOut of money, Skylar realizes the two have no way of going home. As Autumn refuses to let Skylar call either of their mothers, Skylar reaches out to Jasper, who takes them bowling and to karaoke. At the end of the night, Skylar asks Jasper to loan them the money for their bus tickets, which he agrees to. Skylar leaves with Jasper to find an ATM, and Autumn later goes looking for them. She finds them kissing behind a column. Realizing Skylar doesn't like it, Autumn grabs Skylar's hand from behind the column to comfort her.\r\nIn the morning, Autumn goes to her appointment and has the abortion. Autumn and Skylar go to a restaurant, where Skylar asks her questions about the procedure, but Autumn remains vague. The two ride a bus back to Pennsylvania.\r\nCast\r\nSidney Flanigan as Autumn\r\nTalia Ryder as Skylar\r\nTh\u00e9odore Pellerin as Jasper\r\nRyan Eggold as Ted\r\nSharon Van Etten as Mother\r\nKelly Chapman as Social Worker\r\nKim Rios Lin as Anesthesiologist\r\nDrew Seltzer as Manager Rick\r\nCarolina Espiro as Financial Advisor\r\nProduction\r\nIn April 2019, it was announced Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold and Sharon Van Etten had joined the cast of the film, with Eliza Hittman directing from a screenplay she wrote.

At the center, she takes a drug store test that confirms that she is 10 weeks pregnant. Though she immediately wants to terminate the pregnancy, she is given literature on adoption and is shown an anti-abortion video.</p><p>After realizing that she is unable to get an abortion in Pennsylvania without parental consent, she tries to induce a miscarriage by swallowing pills and punching herself in the stomach. When those methods fail, she confides in her cousin, Skylar, that she is pregnant. Skylar steals cash from the grocery store where they work, and the two buy tickets to New York City.</p><p>On the bus they meet Jasper, a young man who is persistently interested in Skylar even though she tries to blow him off.</p><p>At the Planned Parenthood clinic, Autumn learns that the crisis pregnancy center lied to her about how far along she was and that she is actually 18 weeks pregnant. Though she is still able to get an abortion, she must go to a secondary clinic the following morning in order to have the abortion performed.</p><p>Autumn and Skylar spend an uncomfortable night riding the subway and playing games at an arcade. The following morning at the clinic, Autumn learns that a second-trimester abortion is a two-day procedure and that paying for the abortion will wipe out most of her funds. The counselor also asks her a series of questions about her sexual partners which reveal that Autumn's partners have been physically and sexually abusive.</p><p>Out of money, Skylar realizes the two have no way of going home. As Autumn refuses to let Skylar call either of their mothers, Skylar reaches out to Jasper, who takes them bowling and to karaoke. At the end of the night, Skylar asks Jasper to loan them the money for their bus tickets, which he agrees to. Skylar leaves with Jasper to find an ATM, and Autumn later goes looking for them. She finds them kissing behind a column. Realizing Skylar doesn't like it, Autumn grabs Skylar's hand from behind the column to comfort her.</p><p>In the morning, Autumn goes to her appointment and has the abortion. Autumn and Skylar go to a restaurant, where Skylar asks her questions about the procedure, but Autumn remains vague. The two ride a bus back to Pennsylvania.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Sidney Flanigan as Autumn</li><li>Talia Ryder as Skylar</li><li>Th\u00e9odore Pellerin as Jasper</li><li>Ryan Eggold as Ted</li><li>Sharon Van Etten as Mother</li><li>Kelly Chapman as Social Worker</li><li>Kim Rios Lin as Anesthesiologist</li><li>Drew Seltzer as Manager Rick</li><li>Carolina Espiro as Financial Advisor</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>In April 2019, it was announced Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold and Sharon Van Etten had joined the cast of the film, with Eliza Hittman directing from a screenplay she wrote.
