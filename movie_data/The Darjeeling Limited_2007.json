The brothers argue, sulk, resent each other, and fight. The youngest, Jack, estranged from his girlfriend, is attracted to one of the train's attendants. Peter has left his pregnant wife at home, and he buys a venomous snake. After a few days, Francis discloses their surprising and disconcerting destination. Amid foreign surroundings, can the brothers sort out their differences? A funeral, a meditation, a hilltop ritual, and the Bengal Lancer figure in the reconciliation.",

Peter reunites with brothers Francis and Jack on board, the three having not seen each other since their father's funeral a year earlier.\r\nFrancis has recently survived a near-fatal motorcycle accident (leaving his face and head covered in bandages), and thus wishes to reconnect with his brothers on a journey of spiritual self-discovery. He is also secretly searching for their mother, whom the brothers have not seen in many years. With the help of his assistant Brendan, Francis draws up a strict itinerary for the trip and takes his brothers' passports to prevent them from getting off the train too early. The three also continue to grieve over their father's death: carrying bags and suitcases marked with his initials, along with other personal items that belonged to him.\r\nThe train takes the brothers through the countryside and to various Hindu temples, though animosity builds as Jack and Peter become annoyed with Francis' controlling behavior. Francis eventually reveals that they will be meeting with their mother, who has become a nun living at a Christian convent in the Himalayas. Peter and Jack are upset, knowing they wouldn't have come if they had been told this earlier. The tension finally comes to a head, and the three fight on the train, disturbing the other passengers. The Chief Steward, whom the brothers have repeatedly annoyed, has them thrown off with all their luggage. Brendan subsequently quits and returns to the train after giving the boys a letter from their mother; its contents imply that she doesn't want to see them. The brothers thus decide to leave India, go their separate ways, and never return.\r\nAfter trekking through the wilderness, the brothers see three young boys fall into a river while attempting to pull a raft across it. Jack and Francis rescue two of the boys, but Peter fails to save the third, who dies. They carry the body back to the boys' village, where they spend the night and are treated warmly. They attend the funeral the next day and experience a flashback: the three brothers (accompanied by Alice, Peter's wife) are shown heading to their father's funeral, and then stopping to pick up his Porsche from the repair shop, even though the car is not ready. It is revealed that their father's death was a result of him being hit by a taxi, and that their mother did not attend the funeral.\r\nBack in the present, the brothers arrive at the airport, but the brothers suddenly decide to rip up their tickets and go visit their mother. They then reach the convent, where their mother is surprised but happy to see them (and Francis offhandedly implies that his accident was actually a suicide attempt). That night, after the brothers confront their mother for abandoning them, the family gathers together in silence and reconcile. The brothers awake the next morning to find their mother gone, leaving them their breakfast. They decide not to wait for her to return.\r\nAt the train station, the three brothers run for another train called \"Bengal Lancer\" and gleefully discard all their father's suitcases and bags to catch it. On board, Francis offers to return Peter and Jack their passports, but is told instead to hold onto them.\r\nCast\r\nOwen Wilson as Francis\r\nAdrien Brody as Peter\r\nJason Schwartzman as Jack\r\nAmara Karan as Rita\r\nWallace Wolodarsky as Brendan\r\nWaris Ahluwalia as The Chief Steward\r\nIrrfan Khan as The Father\r\nBarbet Schroeder as The Mechanic\r\nCamilla Rutherford as Alice\r\nBill Murray as The Businessman\r\nAnjelica Huston as Patricia\r\nA.P. Singh as Taxi Driver\r\nKumar Pallana as Old Man\r\nDalpat Singh as Waiter\r\nTrudy Matthys as German Lady #1\r\nGurdeep Singh as Chief Steward - Bengal Lancer\r\nNatalie Portman as Jack's Ex-Girlfriend\r\nLocations\r\nMuch of the film was shot in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The Himalaya scenes were shot in Udaipur, and the opening scene of the film was also shot on the streets of Jodhpur. The International Airport shown near the end is the old terminal building of Udaipur Airport. The elephant scene was filmed in Narlai. The scenes set in New York were filmed in Long Island City.\r\nMusic and soundtrack\r\nThe soundtrack features three songs by The Kinks, \"Powerman\", \"Strangers\" and \"This Time Tomorrow\", all from the 1970 album, Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One, as well as \"Play With Fire\" by The Rolling Stones. \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)\" by Peter Sarstedt is prominently featured as well, being played within the film more than once. Most of the album, however, features film score music composed by Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, Merchant-Ivory films, and other artists from Indian cinema. Director Wes Anderson has said that it was Satyajit Ray's movies that made him want to come to India. The works include \"Charu's Theme\", from Ray's 1964 film, Charulata, film-score cues by Shankar Jaikishan and classic works by Claude Debussy and Ludwig van Beethoven. The film ends with the 1969 song \"Les Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" by French singer Joe Dassin, who was the son of blacklisted American director Jules Dassin.\r\nRelease\r\nThe Darjeeling Limited made its world premiere on 3 September 2007 at the Venice Film Festival, where it was in competition for the Golden Lion and won the Little Golden Lion. The film's North American premiere was on 28 September 2007 at the 45th annual New York Film Festival, where it was the opening film. It then opened in a limited commercial release in North America on 5 October 2007. The film opened across North America on 26 October 2007 and in the UK on 23 November 2007, in both territories preceded in showings by Hotel Chevalier. The film grossed $134,938 in two theaters in its opening weekend for an average of $67,469 for each theater.\r\nThe film (widescreen edition) was released on DVD 26 February 2008 on Fox Searchlight, with features limited to a behind-the-scenes documentary, theatrical trailer, and the inclusion of Hotel Chevalier. The film was re-released by the Criterion Collection on 12 October 2010 on both DVD and Blu-ray, the latter being the film's first release on the format.\r\nReception\r\nThe film received generally favorable reviews from critics. As of July 2019, on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 68% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 190 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.61/10. The site's consensus reads: \"With the requisite combination of humor, sorrow and outstanding visuals, The Darjeeling Limited will satisfy Wes Anderson fans.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 35 reviews.

            "html": "<h2>The Darjeeling Limited</h2><p>The Darjeeling Limited is a 2007 American comedy-drama film directed by Wes Anderson which he co-produced with Scott Rudin, Roman Coppola and Lydia Dean Pilcher and co-wrote with Coppola and Jason Schwartzman. The film stars Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Schwartzman as three estranged brothers who agree to meet in India a year after their father's funeral. The cast also includes Waris Ahluwalia, Amara Karan, Barbet Schroeder and Anjelica Huston with Natalie Portman, Camilla Rutherford, Irrfan Khan and Bill Murray in cameo roles.</p><p>The film was released on October 26, 2007 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics and earned $35 million on a $17.5 million budget. The film won the Best Comedy at the Movies for Grownups Awards in 2008 and the Top Films of the Year at the NYFCO Awards in 2007 and also received nominations for the Grand Prix Asturias for Best Feature and the Bodil for Best American Film (Bedste amerikanske film).</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>A businessman in India fails to catch his train\u2014called \"The Darjeeling Limited\"\u2014as it pulls out of a station; he is beaten to it by a younger man, Peter Whitman. Peter reunites with brothers Francis and Jack on board, the three having not seen each other since their father's funeral a year earlier.</p><p>Francis has recently survived a near-fatal motorcycle accident (leaving his face and head covered in bandages), and thus wishes to reconnect with his brothers on a journey of spiritual self-discovery. He is also secretly searching for their mother, whom the brothers have not seen in many years. With the help of his assistant Brendan, Francis draws up a strict itinerary for the trip and takes his brothers' passports to prevent them from getting off the train too early. The three also continue to grieve over their father's death: carrying bags and suitcases marked with his initials, along with other personal items that belonged to him.</p><p>The train takes the brothers through the countryside and to various Hindu temples, though animosity builds as Jack and Peter become annoyed with Francis' controlling behavior. Francis eventually reveals that they will be meeting with their mother, who has become a nun living at a Christian convent in the Himalayas. Peter and Jack are upset, knowing they wouldn't have come if they had been told this earlier. The tension finally comes to a head, and the three fight on the train, disturbing the other passengers. The Chief Steward, whom the brothers have repeatedly annoyed, has them thrown off with all their luggage. Brendan subsequently quits and returns to the train after giving the boys a letter from their mother; its contents imply that she doesn't want to see them. The brothers thus decide to leave India, go their separate ways, and never return.</p><p>After trekking through the wilderness, the brothers see three young boys fall into a river while attempting to pull a raft across it. Jack and Francis rescue two of the boys, but Peter fails to save the third, who dies. They carry the body back to the boys' village, where they spend the night and are treated warmly. They attend the funeral the next day and experience a flashback: the three brothers (accompanied by Alice, Peter's wife) are shown heading to their father's funeral, and then stopping to pick up his Porsche from the repair shop, even though the car is not ready. It is revealed that their father's death was a result of him being hit by a taxi, and that their mother did not attend the funeral.</p><p>Back in the present, the brothers arrive at the airport, but the brothers suddenly decide to rip up their tickets and go visit their mother. They then reach the convent, where their mother is surprised but happy to see them (and Francis offhandedly implies that his accident was actually a suicide attempt). That night, after the brothers confront their mother for abandoning them, the family gathers together in silence and reconcile. The brothers awake the next morning to find their mother gone, leaving them their breakfast. They decide not to wait for her to return.</p><p>At the train station, the three brothers run for another train called \"Bengal Lancer\" and gleefully discard all their father's suitcases and bags to catch it. On board, Francis offers to return Peter and Jack their passports, but is told instead to hold onto them.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Owen Wilson as Francis</li><li>Adrien Brody as Peter</li><li>Jason Schwartzman as Jack</li><li>Amara Karan as Rita</li><li>Wallace Wolodarsky as Brendan</li><li>Waris Ahluwalia as The Chief Steward</li><li>Irrfan Khan as The Father</li><li>Barbet Schroeder as The Mechanic</li><li>Camilla Rutherford as Alice</li><li>Bill Murray as The Businessman</li><li>Anjelica Huston as Patricia</li><li>A.P.

The Himalaya scenes were shot in Udaipur, and the opening scene of the film was also shot on the streets of Jodhpur. The International Airport shown near the end is the old terminal building of Udaipur Airport. The elephant scene was filmed in Narlai. The scenes set in New York were filmed in Long Island City.</p><br/><h3>Music and soundtrack</h3><p>The soundtrack features three songs by The Kinks, \"Powerman\", \"Strangers\" and \"This Time Tomorrow\", all from the 1970 album, Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One, as well as \"Play With Fire\" by The Rolling Stones. \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)\" by Peter Sarstedt is prominently featured as well, being played within the film more than once. Most of the album, however, features film score music composed by Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, Merchant-Ivory films, and other artists from Indian cinema. Director Wes Anderson has said that it was Satyajit Ray's movies that made him want to come to India. The works include \"Charu's Theme\", from Ray's 1964 film, Charulata, film-score cues by Shankar Jaikishan and classic works by Claude Debussy and Ludwig van Beethoven. The film ends with the 1969 song \"Les Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" by French singer Joe Dassin, who was the son of blacklisted American director Jules Dassin.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>The Darjeeling Limited made its world premiere on 3 September 2007 at the Venice Film Festival, where it was in competition for the Golden Lion and won the Little Golden Lion. The film's North American premiere was on 28 September 2007 at the 45th annual New York Film Festival, where it was the opening film. It then opened in a limited commercial release in North America on 5 October 2007. The film opened across North America on 26 October 2007 and in the UK on 23 November 2007, in both territories preceded in showings by Hotel Chevalier. The film grossed $134,938 in two theaters in its opening weekend for an average of $67,469 for each theater.</p><p>The film (widescreen edition) was released on DVD 26 February 2008 on Fox Searchlight, with features limited to a behind-the-scenes documentary, theatrical trailer, and the inclusion of Hotel Chevalier. The film was re-released by the Criterion Collection on 12 October 2010 on both DVD and Blu-ray, the latter being the film's first release on the format.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>The film received generally favorable reviews from critics. As of July 2019, on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 68% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 190 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.61/10. The site's consensus reads: \"With the requisite combination of humor, sorrow and outstanding visuals, The Darjeeling Limited will satisfy Wes Anderson fans.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 35 reviews. The film has a rating of 7.2 out of 10 on the Internet Movie Database.</p><p>Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 3.5 out of 4, calling the film's Indian context as one of its main highlights.
