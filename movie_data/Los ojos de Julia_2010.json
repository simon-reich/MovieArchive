As she tries to remove the noose, the stool beneath her is kicked away, leaving her to die. Miles away, Sara's twin sister, Julia, collapses, sensing something amiss.\r\nJulia, who has the same degenerative disease but can still see, is tormented by Sara's death and by the feeling of another presence nearby. She insists Sara was not depressed as she was awaiting surgery to restore her vision. Her husband, Isaac, insists she stop investigating, and as her doctor has informed him that Sara had eye surgery that was not successful.\r\nJulia meets Sara's elderly blind neighbor Soledad, who has a pessimistic view that Isaac will leave her, as even Soledad's own son, \u00c1ngel, abandoned her after she went blind. After hearing that Sara had a boyfriend and they visited a hotel nearby, Julia goes there with Isaac. She is approached by an elderly janitor, Cr\u00e9spulo, who warns her of \"men who live in shadows,\" who are dangerous because they are tired of being ignored.\r\nIsaac disappears and Julia is convinced that the \"invisible man\" has kidnapped him, though the police are skeptical. Someone kills Cr\u00e9spulo, but police rule it an accident. Julia's eyesight continues to deteriorate. When Julia and the inspector return to Sara's house, the inspector discovers a suicide note and Isaac's body. Julia, now fully blind, cannot see anything.\r\nA grieving Julia learns Isaac's suicide note declared he loved Sara, with whom he had been having an affair for six months. However, an eye donor is found, so the operation to save Julia's sight goes ahead. She is told she must wear bandages to protect her eyes from light for two weeks, and the morgue agrees to keep Isaac's body so she can see him to say goodbye. She returns to Sara's house with the daily help of a home nursing aid, Iv\u00e1n.\r\nJulia is plagued by disorientation and convinced that somebody is lurking in the house; but Iv\u00e1n's patience helps her regain her independence. Four days before Julia is due to remove her bandages, an unseen man almost succeeds in drugging Julia while she sleeps; however, she wakes, panicked, and accidentally hits the intruder. She flees to a neighbour, Blasco, who makes advances on her. She escapes, paging Iv\u00e1n, who finds her hiding outside in the rain and escorts her to his apartment.\r\nWhile Iv\u00e1n is out, Julia hears the voice of Blasco's shy daughter, L\u00eda, who tells her that Iv\u00e1n is the \"invisible man\" who tormented and blinded Sara by ruining her operation, forced Isaac to write the fake suicide note before killing him, and has walls covered with photographs of Julia and Sara. Julia hides in the bathroom where, four days early, she tears off her bandages, desperate to see. Julia exits the bathroom and sees Iv\u00e1n's walls covered with photographs of the twins as well as L\u00eda's bloodied body.\r\nIv\u00e1n returns to the apartment, where Julia pretends that she is crying because her operation has failed. He believes her momentarily before leading her to the body of the real Iv\u00e1n; Julia's scream betrays the fact that she can see.\"Iv\u00e1n\" tells her he loves her and wants them to be together as long as her sight is gone, as since blind women are the only ones who need him.\r\n\"Iv\u00e1n\" drives Julia back to Sara's, where she flees to Soledad's. \"Iv\u00e1n\" chases her and addresses Soledad as Mom, revealing himself as her missing son, \u00c1ngel. A candle and glasses betray the fact that Soledad is not really blind as she knocks Julia out, at which point an enraged \u00c1ngel attacks his mother and blinds her. Julia escapes and manages to contact the police. She uses a flashlight to show the police a bloodied \u00c1ngel hiding in a corner of the room. Finally visible, he slits his own throat.\r\nAt the hospital, Julia is told the damage to her new eyes is irreversible. Using her last few hours of vision, she finally says goodbye to Isaac's corpse, as it is revealed that he donated his eyes to her.\r\nCast\r\nBel\u00e9n Rueda as Julia Levin/Sara\r\nLlu\u00eds Homar as Isaac\r\nFrancesc Orella as Inspector Dimas\r\nPablo Derqui as \u00c1ngel\r\nJulia Guti\u00e9rrez Caba as Soledad\r\nDaniel Grao as Dr. Rom\u00e1n\r\nBoris Ruiz as Blasco\r\nJoan Dalmau as Cr\u00e9spulo\r\nAndrea Hermosa as L\u00eda Blasco\r\nCarlus F\u00e0brega as Subinspector\r\nDani Codina as Iv\u00e1n\r\nClara Segura as Mina\r\nLaura Barbaas Dela\r\nProduction\r\nGuillermo del Toro worked a second time as producer for a Spanish genre production and co-produced the film with Joaqu\u00edn Padr\u00f3 and Mar Targarona for Rodar y Rodar Cine y Televisi\u00f3n. The film starred Bel\u00e9n Rueda and Llu\u00eds Homar. Guillem Morales wrote the screenplay co-authored with Oriol Paulo. The film was co-financed by Focus Features International.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nThe score was created by Barcelona based film composer Fernando Vel\u00e1zquez.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film premiered on 20 October 2010 in Spain. It was released in the United Kingdom as Julia's Eyes by Optimum Releasing. In Australia it was released as Julia's Eyes by Umbrella Entertainment on 2 June 2011.\r\nReception\r\nJulia's Eyes received mostly positive reviews. It holds received a 92% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.\r\nPhilip French of The Guardian wrote, \"Using blindness as a plot device, a metaphor for social awareness and as a numinous experience that romantically links minds, it's a fascinating, broken-backed picture full of riveting twists and dubious psychology.\" Charlotte O'Sullivan of the London Evening Standard praised the film and Rueda in particular, writing, \"Rueda is a fantastic actress, tightly wound, but never brittle. From the minute she's on screen we identify with Julia's plight.\"\r\nPhilippa Hawker of The Age wrote, \"Julia's Eyes becomes a little incoherent as it plunges towards resolution, but it's unerringly stylish and whole-heartedly suspenseful along the way. Morales toys with red herrings, references Hitchcock, amps up the tension, spills blood; he also plays with the camera's ability to reveal and conceal simultaneously. In the end, although the film takes on the traits of a classic 'don't go back inside the house' slasher movie, it's the quiet, slowly-building confrontations, one on one, that linger in the memory.\"",

She flees to a neighbour, Blasco, who makes advances on her. She escapes, paging Iv\u00e1n, who finds her hiding outside in the rain and escorts her to his apartment.</p><p>While Iv\u00e1n is out, Julia hears the voice of Blasco's shy daughter, L\u00eda, who tells her that Iv\u00e1n is the \"invisible man\" who tormented and blinded Sara by ruining her operation, forced Isaac to write the fake suicide note before killing him, and has walls covered with photographs of Julia and Sara. Julia hides in the bathroom where, four days early, she tears off her bandages, desperate to see. Julia exits the bathroom and sees Iv\u00e1n's walls covered with photographs of the twins as well as L\u00eda's bloodied body.</p><p>Iv\u00e1n returns to the apartment, where Julia pretends that she is crying because her operation has failed. He believes her momentarily before leading her to the body of the real Iv\u00e1n; Julia's scream betrays the fact that she can see.\"Iv\u00e1n\" tells her he loves her and wants them to be together as long as her sight is gone, as since blind women are the only ones who need him.</p><p>\"Iv\u00e1n\" drives Julia back to Sara's, where she flees to Soledad's. \"Iv\u00e1n\" chases her and addresses Soledad as Mom, revealing himself as her missing son, \u00c1ngel. A candle and glasses betray the fact that Soledad is not really blind as she knocks Julia out, at which point an enraged \u00c1ngel attacks his mother and blinds her. Julia escapes and manages to contact the police. She uses a flashlight to show the police a bloodied \u00c1ngel hiding in a corner of the room. Finally visible, he slits his own throat.</p><p>At the hospital, Julia is told the damage to her new eyes is irreversible. Using her last few hours of vision, she finally says goodbye to Isaac's corpse, as it is revealed that he donated his eyes to her.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Bel\u00e9n Rueda as Julia Levin/Sara</li><li>Llu\u00eds Homar as Isaac</li><li>Francesc Orella as Inspector Dimas</li><li>Pablo Derqui as \u00c1ngel</li><li>Julia Guti\u00e9rrez Caba as Soledad</li><li>Daniel Grao as Dr. Rom\u00e1n</li><li>Boris Ruiz as Blasco</li><li>Joan Dalmau as Cr\u00e9spulo</li><li>Andrea Hermosa as L\u00eda Blasco</li><li>Carlus F\u00e0brega as Subinspector</li><li>Dani Codina as Iv\u00e1n</li><li>Clara Segura as Mina</li><li>Laura Barbaas Dela</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>Guillermo del Toro worked a second time as producer for a Spanish genre production and co-produced the film with Joaqu\u00edn Padr\u00f3 and Mar Targarona for Rodar y Rodar Cine y Televisi\u00f3n. The film starred Bel\u00e9n Rueda and Llu\u00eds Homar. Guillem Morales wrote the screenplay co-authored with Oriol Paulo. The film was co-financed by Focus Features International.</p><br/><h3>Soundtrack</h3><p>The score was created by Barcelona based film composer Fernando Vel\u00e1zquez.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>The film premiered on 20 October 2010 in Spain. It was released in the United Kingdom as Julia's Eyes by Optimum Releasing. In Australia it was released as Julia's Eyes by Umbrella Entertainment on 2 June 2011.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>Julia's Eyes received mostly positive reviews. It holds received a 92% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.</p><p>Philip French of The Guardian wrote, \"Using blindness as a plot device, a metaphor for social awareness and as a numinous experience that romantically links minds, it's a fascinating, broken-backed picture full of riveting twists and dubious psychology.\" Charlotte O'Sullivan of the London Evening Standard praised the film and Rueda in particular, writing, \"Rueda is a fantastic actress, tightly wound, but never brittle. From the minute she's on screen we identify with Julia's plight.\"</p><p>Philippa Hawker of The Age wrote, \"Julia's Eyes becomes a little incoherent as it plunges towards resolution, but it's unerringly stylish and whole-heartedly suspenseful along the way. Morales toys with red herrings, references Hitchcock, amps up the tension, spills blood; he also plays with the camera's ability to reveal and conceal simultaneously. In the end, although the film takes on the traits of a classic 'don't go back inside the house' slasher movie, it's the quiet, slowly-building confrontations, one on one, that linger in the memory.\"</p><br/>"
