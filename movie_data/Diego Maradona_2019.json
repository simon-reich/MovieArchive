The film was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2019.\r\nSynopsis\r\nDiego Maradona documents and centres around the time Maradona transferred from FC Barcelona to S.S.C. Napoli in 1984, eventually winning Serie A and the 1988\u201389 UEFA Cup with the Italian team.\r\nProduction\r\nThe concept of producing a documentary film about Maradona came after the director released the film Amy in 2015. Due to difficulty on finding a story with a beginning and an end, the director opted on Naples as being the centrepiece for the film. During the London Olympics in 2012, producer Paul Martin contacted the director after discovering archival footage but after the release of Senna the idea was pushed back. Martin and Gay-Rees met with someone outside of Naples who owned private material. The idea to document Maradona\u2019s life began in 1981 by his first agent Jorge Cyterszpiler. This led to two Argentine cameramen recording hundreds of hours of film. However, the film never got produced. In Buenos Aires more archival footage was discovered in the home of Maradona\u2019s ex-wife Claudia in a trunk untouched for 30 years.\r\nRelease\r\nThe world premiere of Diego Maradona was screened out of competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 19 May 2019.

The film debuted at No. 29 on the UK Official Film Chart on 20 November 2019.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nDiego Maradona grossed \u00a3966,936 ($1,174,464) in the United Kingdom and over $1,443,342 in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $2,617,806. It made the largest share of its box office revenue in the United Kingdom as well. However, it failed to make any money at the domestic box office during its release in North America.\r\nIn the United Kingdom it grossed \u00a3284,949 ($358,787) from 139 cinemas in its opening weekend, finishing ninth at the box office. It grossed another \u00a3130,406 ($166,186) adding 53 screens for a total of 195 in its second weekend and grossing \u00a3609,735 ($777,029) through 10 days.
