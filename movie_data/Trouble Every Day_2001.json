When Shane seeks out a self-exiled expert in the field, he happens upon the doctor's wife, another victim of the same malady. She has become so dangerous and emotionally paralyzed by the condition that her husband imprisons her by day in their home. It is Shane's chance encounter with this woman that triggers an event so cataclysmic and shocking it might just lead him to rediscover the tranquility he seeks to restore for himself and his new bride.",

The film's soundtrack is provided by Tindersticks.\r\nAlice Houri, who starred in Denis' previous film N\u00e9nette et Boni, has a small cameo as a girl on a metro who watches Shane.\r\nPlot\r\nAn American couple, Dr. Shane Brown and his wife June, go to Paris, ostensibly for their honeymoon. In reality, Shane has come to Paris to hunt down neuroscientist Dr. L\u00e9o S\u00e9meneau and his wife, Cor\u00e9, whom Shane once knew and was obsessed with. Despite having had a prolific career, L\u00e9o is now working as a general practitioner to keep a low profile. He locks Cor\u00e9 in their house every day, but she occasionally escapes and initiates sex with men before violently murdering them. To protect her, L\u00e9o buries the bodies.\r\nShane begins investigating S\u00e9meneau's whereabouts. A doctor who once worked with L\u00e9o eventually gives Shane the couple's address, explaining that Cor\u00e9 is unwell. Meanwhile, two young men who have been casing the S\u00e9meneau home break in, and ones of them finds Cor\u00e9 in a boarded-up room. After she seduces him, they begin to have sex, but she violently bites him to death, ripping out his tongue with her teeth. When Shane arrives at the house, he discovers Cor\u00e9 covered in blood. She tries to bite him, but Shane is able to overpower her. As he strangles her, she drops a match, setting the house on fire. Shane leaves her to be consumed by the flames. Just after Shane departs, L\u00e9o arrives and witnesses the carnage and the dead Cor\u00e9.\r\nAfter Cor\u00e9's death, Shane becomes strange and distant. While having sex with his wife, he stops and finishes by masturbating, then runs away from her and adopts a puppy. Finally, he goes to a hotel where he brutally rapes a maid and bites her to death, then showers and washes the blood from his body. His wife enters and the couple agree to return home.\r\nCast\r\nVincent Gallo as Shane Brown\r\nTricia Vessey as June Brown\r\nB\u00e9atrice Dalle as Cor\u00e9\r\nAlex Descas as L\u00e9o Semenau\r\nFlorence Loiret Caille as Christelle\r\nNicolas Duvauchelle as Erwan\r\nRapha\u00ebl Neal as Ludo\r\nJos\u00e9 Garcia as Choart\r\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lapiower as Mal\u00e9cot\r\nMarilu Marini as Friessen\r\nAurore Cl\u00e9ment as Jeanne\r\nRelease\r\nTrouble Every Day was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.\r\nReception\r\nThe film received mixed reactions from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 49% rating, based on 49 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"An erotic thriller dulled by a messy narrative.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\r\nDerek Elley of Variety wrote that it is \"over-long, under-written and needlessly obscure instead of genuinely atmospheric.\" Chris Fujiwara of The Boston Globe was more positive, but concludes by calling the film \"a success in some sense, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.\"\r\nLater, the film developed a small following who admire it for its themes of existentialism and its unique take on the horror genre as well as gender roles. It was given an in depth analysis by Salon.com which looked at the intricacies of the film, particularly the metaphorical nature of the narrative. At Film Freak Central, Walter Chaw said, \"Plaintive and sad, Claire Denis' Trouble Every Day is a rare combination of honesty, beauty, and maybe even genius.\" The film has been associated with the New French Extremity.",
            "html": "<h2>Trouble Every Day (film)</h2><p>Trouble Every Day is a 2001 French erotic horror film directed by Claire Denis and written by Denis and Jean-Pol Fargeau. It stars Vincent Gallo, Tricia Vessey, B\u00e9atrice Dalle, Alex Descas and Marilu Marini. The film's soundtrack is provided by Tindersticks.</p><p>Alice Houri, who starred in Denis' previous film N\u00e9nette et Boni, has a small cameo as a girl on a metro who watches Shane.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>An American couple, Dr. Shane Brown and his wife June, go to Paris, ostensibly for their honeymoon. In reality, Shane has come to Paris to hunt down neuroscientist Dr. L\u00e9o S\u00e9meneau and his wife, Cor\u00e9, whom Shane once knew and was obsessed with. Despite having had a prolific career, L\u00e9o is now working as a general practitioner to keep a low profile. He locks Cor\u00e9 in their house every day, but she occasionally escapes and initiates sex with men before violently murdering them. To protect her, L\u00e9o buries the bodies.</p><p>Shane begins investigating S\u00e9meneau's whereabouts. A doctor who once worked with L\u00e9o eventually gives Shane the couple's address, explaining that Cor\u00e9 is unwell. Meanwhile, two young men who have been casing the S\u00e9meneau home break in, and ones of them finds Cor\u00e9 in a boarded-up room. After she seduces him, they begin to have sex, but she violently bites him to death, ripping out his tongue with her teeth. When Shane arrives at the house, he discovers Cor\u00e9 covered in blood. She tries to bite him, but Shane is able to overpower her. As he strangles her, she drops a match, setting the house on fire. Shane leaves her to be consumed by the flames. Just after Shane departs, L\u00e9o arrives and witnesses the carnage and the dead Cor\u00e9.</p><p>After Cor\u00e9's death, Shane becomes strange and distant. While having sex with his wife, he stops and finishes by masturbating, then runs away from her and adopts a puppy. Finally, he goes to a hotel where he brutally rapes a maid and bites her to death, then showers and washes the blood from his body. His wife enters and the couple agree to return home.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Vincent Gallo as Shane Brown</li><li>Tricia Vessey as June Brown</li><li>B\u00e9atrice Dalle as Cor\u00e9</li><li>Alex Descas as L\u00e9o Semenau</li><li>Florence Loiret Caille as Christelle</li><li>Nicolas Duvauchelle as Erwan</li><li>Rapha\u00ebl Neal as Ludo</li><li>Jos\u00e9 Garcia as Choart</li><li>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lapiower as Mal\u00e9cot</li><li>Marilu Marini as Friessen</li><li>Aurore Cl\u00e9ment as Jeanne</li></ul><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>Trouble Every Day was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>The film received mixed reactions from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 49% rating, based on 49 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"An erotic thriller dulled by a messy narrative.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".</p><p>Derek Elley of Variety wrote that it is \"over-long, under-written and needlessly obscure instead of genuinely atmospheric.\" Chris Fujiwara of The Boston Globe was more positive, but concludes by calling the film \"a success in some sense, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.\"</p><p>Later, the film developed a small following who admire it for its themes of existentialism and its unique take on the horror genre as well as gender roles. It was given an in depth analysis by Salon.com which looked at the intricacies of the film, particularly the metaphorical nature of the narrative. At Film Freak Central, Walter Chaw said, \"Plaintive and sad, Claire Denis' Trouble Every Day is a rare combination of honesty, beauty, and maybe even genius.\" The film has been associated with the New French Extremity.</p><br/>"
