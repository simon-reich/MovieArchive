    "plot": "After the untimely death of 16-year-old Martin's father on the operating table, little by little, a deep and empathetic bond begins to form between him and the respected cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Steven Murphy. At first, expensive gifts and then an invitation for dinner will soon earn the orphaned teenager the approval of Dr Steven's perfect family, even though right from the start, a vague, yet unnerving feeling overshadows Martin's honest intent. And then, unexpectedly, the idyllic family is smitten by a fierce and pitiless punishment, while at the same time, everything will start falling apart as the innocents have to suffer. In the end, as the sins of one burden the entire family, only an unimaginable and unendurable decision that demands a pure sacrifice can purge the soul. But to find catharsis, one must first admit the sin.",

It has received positive reviews, and grossed over $6 million worldwide.\r\nPlot\r\nSteven Murphy, a skilled cardiothoracic surgeon, finishes an open heart surgery, and goes to a diner, where he meets a teenage boy named Martin. Afterward, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna, and their children, teenager Kim and younger son Bob. Anna and Steven have sex where Anna pretends to be under the effect of anaesthesia. He later tells Anna that Martin's father died in a car accident ten years earlier, and that he has taken an interest in the boy to help him deal with his grief. Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems rather taken with him.\r\nMartin returns the favor by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. After the meal, Steven tries to leave but Martin insists he watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through, and his mother makes a romantic advance on Steven by complimenting his hands and attempting to kiss them and suck them. However, Steven immediately rebuffs her and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning, Bob awakens and finds he cannot feel his legs; he has become paralyzed. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where an examination reveals that nothing is physically wrong. Meanwhile, Kim visits Martin. She tells him that she loves him and undresses. Martin says that he has to go home. He takes a peep and goes away.\r\nThe next morning, Martin meets Steven and reveals the truth: his father did not die in the crash but during surgery that Steven himself performed after the accident. Martin blames Steven for his father's death. Martin explains that, to \"balance\" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of the members of his own. If not, the Murphys will slowly die after four stages; paralysis is the first stage, followed by self-imposed starvation, bleeding from the eyes, and finally death. Steven attempts to dismiss these claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing food (the second stage). Soon after, Kim also loses the use of her legs and the willingness to eat.\r\nKim receives a call from Martin at the hospital. During the conversation, she regains the use of her legs, only to lose mobility again when the connection is broken. This convinces Anna that Martin has the power to follow through on his threats. She visits Martin to ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. Martin responds that \"it's the only thing...that's close to justice\". Anna, suspecting that her formerly alcoholic husband may have been drinking on the day of the operation, speaks to Steven's anesthesiologist, Matthew, who reveals that Steven did in fact have a few drinks that morning in return of sexual favour by Anna. Matthew bargains Anna into masturbating him as payment for the information. After all tests are exhausted the hospital is at a loss for a solution, so Anna insists the children are transported back home, where they are tube-fed. Steven then kidnaps Martin, brutally beating him and demanding that he reverse the condition of the children. Martin is unaffected, merely warning Steven that time is running out.\r\nKim and Bob argue over who their father will choose, while Anna claims that killing one of the children is clearly the only option, as they can have another. Attempting to reach a decision, Steven meets with the school principal and questions which of his children is most academically gifted. Kim, having a crush on Martin, attempts to persuade him to heal her legs again so they may elope together; when unsuccessful, she attempts to save herself by escaping and crawling through the neighborhood. Steven and Anna retrieve her. As Steven disinfects her wounds, Kim tells him how much she loves him and volunteers to be the one to die. The next morning, Anna releases Martin as holding him captive was no use. Bob begins bleeding from the eyes (the final stage before imminent death), causing all to panic. Rather than choose, Steven binds Kim, Bob, and Anna to chairs, covers their heads, and pulls a woolen hat over his own face. He loads a rifle, spins in circles, and fires.

            "html": "<h2>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</h2><p>The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a 2017 psychological thriller film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, from a screenplay by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou. It stars Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Alicia Silverstone, and Bill Camp. The story is based on the ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides.</p><p>The film follows a cardiac surgeon (Farrell) who secretly befriends a teenage boy (Keoghan) with a connection to his past. He introduces the boy to his family, who begin to fall mysteriously ill.</p><p>The Killing of a Sacred Deer was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. The film was theatrically released in the United States on October 20, 2017, by A24, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on November 3, 2017, by Curzon Artificial Eye. It has received positive reviews, and grossed over $6 million worldwide.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Steven Murphy, a skilled cardiothoracic surgeon, finishes an open heart surgery, and goes to a diner, where he meets a teenage boy named Martin. Afterward, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna, and their children, teenager Kim and younger son Bob. Anna and Steven have sex where Anna pretends to be under the effect of anaesthesia. He later tells Anna that Martin's father died in a car accident ten years earlier, and that he has taken an interest in the boy to help him deal with his grief. Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems rather taken with him.</p><p>Martin returns the favor by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. After the meal, Steven tries to leave but Martin insists he watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through, and his mother makes a romantic advance on Steven by complimenting his hands and attempting to kiss them and suck them. However, Steven immediately rebuffs her and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning, Bob awakens and finds he cannot feel his legs; he has become paralyzed. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where an examination reveals that nothing is physically wrong. Meanwhile, Kim visits Martin. She tells him that she loves him and undresses. Martin says that he has to go home. He takes a peep and goes away.</p><p>The next morning, Martin meets Steven and reveals the truth: his father did not die in the crash but during surgery that Steven himself performed after the accident. Martin blames Steven for his father's death. Martin explains that, to \"balance\" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of the members of his own. If not, the Murphys will slowly die after four stages; paralysis is the first stage, followed by self-imposed starvation, bleeding from the eyes, and finally death. Steven attempts to dismiss these claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing food (the second stage). Soon after, Kim also loses the use of her legs and the willingness to eat.</p><p>Kim receives a call from Martin at the hospital. During the conversation, she regains the use of her legs, only to lose mobility again when the connection is broken. This convinces Anna that Martin has the power to follow through on his threats. She visits Martin to ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. Martin responds that \"it's the only thing...that's close to justice\". Anna, suspecting that her formerly alcoholic husband may have been drinking on the day of the operation, speaks to Steven's anesthesiologist, Matthew, who reveals that Steven did in fact have a few drinks that morning in return of sexual favour by Anna. Matthew bargains Anna into masturbating him as payment for the information. After all tests are exhausted the hospital is at a loss for a solution, so Anna insists the children are transported back home, where they are tube-fed. Steven then kidnaps Martin, brutally beating him and demanding that he reverse the condition of the children. Martin is unaffected, merely warning Steven that time is running out.</p><p>Kim and Bob argue over who their father will choose, while Anna claims that killing one of the children is clearly the only option, as they can have another. Attempting to reach a decision, Steven meets with the school principal and questions which of his children is most academically gifted. Kim, having a crush on Martin, attempts to persuade him to heal her legs again so they may elope together; when unsuccessful, she attempts to save herself by escaping and crawling through the neighborhood. Steven and Anna retrieve her. As Steven disinfects her wounds, Kim tells him how much she loves him and volunteers to be the one to die. The next morning, Anna releases Martin as holding him captive was no use. Bob begins bleeding from the eyes (the final stage before imminent death), causing all to panic. Rather than choose, Steven binds Kim, Bob, and Anna to chairs, covers their heads, and pulls a woolen hat over his own face. He loads a rifle, spins in circles, and fires. The first two shots miss, but the third kills Bob.</p><p>Some time later, the family visits the same diner where Steven met with Martin. Martin enters and stares at them; he and the family briefly lock eyes. As the Murphys leave, Martin gazes after them, and Kim turns to look back at Martin as she leaves.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Colin Farrell as Steven Murphy</li><li>Nicole Kidman as Anna Murphy</li><li>Barry Keoghan as Martin</li><li>Raffey Cassidy as Kim Murphy</li><li>Sunny Suljic as Bob Murphy</li><li>Alicia Silverstone as Martin's mother</li><li>Bill Camp as Matthew</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>On May 11, 2016, it was announced that Colin Farrell had been cast in the film, with Yorgos Lanthimos directing from a screenplay he had written with Efthymis Filipou.
