For her performance, Feldstein was nominated for Best Actress \u2013 Comedy or Musical at the 77th Golden Globe Awards.\r\nPlot\r\nHigh school seniors Amy and Molly have been best friends since childhood, but are considered pretentious by their peers. Amy is out and has a crush on a girl named Ryan; Molly urges her to pursue a relationship with Ryan before they graduate. On the eve of graduation, Molly confronts classmates talking about her in the bathroom. She tells them she got into Yale, but they reveal that, despite their partying, they too got into prestigious colleges and job recruitments. Furious, Molly tells Amy they should have enjoyed their time in high school more. She proposes they go to a graduation party held by classmate Nick, and Amy reluctantly agrees.\r\nRealizing that neither of them knows the party's address, Molly calls Jared, a wealthy classmate who likes her. He brings them to his party aboard a yacht; only his drug-crazed friend Gigi is there, and she feeds the girls strawberries before jumping off the yacht. Amy suggests they go home, but Molly calls a \"Malala\" (their code for unconditionally doing what the other wants to do). The girls call a Lyft and are shocked to be picked up by their principal, Jordan Brown.\r\nTo prepare Amy for potential sex with Ryan, Molly insists they watch pornography, which accidentally plays through the car speakers. Brown drops them off at what they think is Nick's aunt's house but turns out to be the home of their classmate George, who is hosting a murder mystery party. They encounter Gigi, who reveals that the strawberries were laced with powerful hallucinogenic drugs. Amy and Molly experience a bad trip and hallucinate that they are George's sister's plastic fashion dolls. They manage to escape George's house, but Gigi reveals that Molly secretly likes Nick.\r\nDespite wanting to go home, Amy insists they press on so Molly can consummate her crush on Nick. The girls head to the library, where they see pizza boxes in an online video of Nick's party and acquire the address from the pizza delivery man. Amy accidentally leaves her phone in his car, and Molly's phone battery lasts just long enough to call their favorite teacher, Miss Fine, who gives them a change of clothes and a ride to Nick's party.\r\nThere, Amy finds Ryan making out with Nick. Heartbroken, she finds Molly and calls her own \"Malala,\u201d which Molly refuses, thinking she still has a chance with Nick. Amy angrily reveals that she is not just spending the summer in Botswana but taking an entire gap year there because she resents how Molly always tries to control her life.\r\nThe two friends argue in front of the entire party. Amy runs to the bathroom, finding her classmate Hope there; they are initially combative until Amy kisses her. Jared appears, and he and Molly have a heartfelt conversation about how no one at school really knows them. Amy and Hope start to have sex, but Amy vomits on Hope. Cops arrive, and the partiers scatter. Unable to find Amy, Molly is driven home by Triple A, a popular student with a promiscuous reputation, and they bond over the stereotypes they both have endured.\r\nWaking up on graduation day, Molly checks her phone and discovers her classmates praising Amy for creating a diversion at the party, allowing everyone to escape the police while getting herself arrested. Molly visits Amy in jail and apologizes for her manipulative actions, and they reconcile. Learning the pizza delivery man is a serial killer, they trade that information to free Amy, and take Jared's car to graduation. Molly kisses Jared onstage and gives an improvised valedictorian speech, receiving a standing ovation.\r\nA few days later, as Molly helps Amy prepare for her trip to Botswana, Hope visits to give Amy her phone number. Molly drives Amy to the airport, where they share a tearful goodbye. As Molly drives away, Amy jumps in front of her car, saying she has time to hang out before her flight; she suggests they get pancakes, and Molly ecstatically accepts.\r\nCast\r\nBeanie Feldstein as Molly Davidson\r\nKaitlyn Dever as Amy Antsler\r\nJessica Williams as Miss Fine\r\nLisa Kudrow as Charmaine Antsler\r\nWill Forte as Doug Antsler\r\nJason Sudeikis as Principal Jordan Brown\r\nBillie Lourd as Gigi\r\nDiana Silvers as Hope\r\nSkyler Gisondo as Jared\r\nMolly Gordon as Annabelle, or \"Triple A\"\r\nNoah Galvin as George\r\nAustin Crute as Alan\r\nVictoria Ruesga as Ryan\r\nEduardo Franco as Theo\r\nNico Hiraga as Tanner\r\nMason Gooding as Nick Howland\r\nMike O'Brien as Pat the Pizza Guy\r\nBluesy Burke as Cindy\r\nChristopher Avila as Rob\r\nStephanie Styles as Alison\r\nAdam Simon Krist as Dick\r\nGideon Lang as Skip\r\nMaya Rudolph as Motivational Voice\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nAn early version of the screenplay, Book Smart by Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins, was circulated in 2009 and appeared on the 2009 Black List; in 2014 Susanna Fogel revised the screenplay, rewriting one lead character as a lesbian and revising the story so the girls are not seeking boyfriends for the prom, but are going to an after-prom party.\r\nFollowing the revisions, Annapurna Pictures purchased the screenplay and approached Gloria Sanchez Productions to produce it; Gloria Sanchez' Jessica Elbaum pitched the screenplay to Olivia Wilde, who read the screenplay and two days later expressed admiration for it. Megan Ellison, Chelsea Bernard, David Distenfeld, Will Ferrell, Adam McKay, and Elbaum would serve as producers on the film. Screenwriter Katie Silberman was hired for more revisions in spring 2018, and to update the story. Silberman explored a new concept:\r\nWhat if the two friends realized that they did high school all wrong? What if they realized that everyone they thought just partied and wasted their high-school years were going to Ivy League schools just like them?\r\nAccording to Silberman, \"Olivia's mantra to all of us was that high school is war\". Wilde also envisioned \"a drug trip where the girls turned into Barbie dolls\" and gave Silberman the responsibility of where to incorporate it into the story.\r\nCasting\r\nIn February 2018, Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein joined the cast of the film. In May 2018, Billie Lourd and Skyler Gisondo joined the cast of the film. That same month, Jason Sudeikis, Lisa Kudrow, Jessica Williams, Will Forte, Mike O'Brien, Mason Gooding, Noah Galvin, Diana Silvers, Austin Crute, Eduardo Franco, Molly Gordon, and Nico Hiraga joined the cast of the film.\r\nSilvers was initially asked to audition for Ryan, but felt her appearance was not ideal for the character and auditioned for Hope instead. Wilde also urged Feldstein and Dever to live together to develop a rapport. The two actresses were roommates in Los Angeles for ten weeks. Wilde also asked the cast to read the screenplay and signal if they found dialogue that felt \"inauthentic ... rewrite it in your own voice\". Silberman continued to write after casting, finding it easy to come up with dialogue to fit Feldstein and Dever. Silberman particularly credited the complimentary language the characters use to Feldstein, who frequently posted \"I have no breath\" to Instagram.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in May 2018 around the San Fernando Valley.\r\nWilde and production designer Katie Byron decorated the bedrooms seen in the film, including with trophies and depictions of prominent American women Michelle Obama and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\r\nThe animated dolls sequence was created over five months by a team of thirty people. Wilde had voiced a character on the series Bojack Horseman and contacted ShadowMachine the animation studio behind Bojack to create the sequence. Due to script rewrites parts of the animated scene involving a Roomba and a scene showing glitter vomit, were cut from the film.\r\nRelease\r\nIt had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2019. It was released wide in the United States on May 24, 2019. It was also released in France on Netflix the same day.\r\nHome media\r\nBooksmart was released on digital download on August 20, 2019, and on DVD and Blu-ray on September 3, 2019.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nBooksmart grossed $22.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $24.9 million.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, Booksmart was released alongside Aladdin and Brightburn, and was projected to gross around $12 million from 2,505 theaters in its four-day opening weekend. The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $875,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up underperforming, debuting to just $6.9 million (a four-day total of $8.7 million), finishing in sixth place. Industry publications insisted that although the targeted young female demographic did turn out to the film, it should have begun with a limited release and expanded, similar to the R-rated, female-led high school comedy Lady Bird in 2017, and that Booksmart failed to stand out in the crowded marketplace. In its second weekend the film made $3.3 million, dropping 52% and finishing in eighth.\r\nThe film's largest market outside North America was the United Kingdom, where it grossed around US$1.8 million (\u00a31.5 million) after seven weeks in theaters.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 357 reviews, with an average rating of 8.28/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Fast-paced, funny, and fresh, Booksmart does the seemingly impossible by adding a smart new spin to the coming-of-age comedy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 80%. In December 2018, Rotten Tomatoes named Booksmart the #1 comedy of the decade on the site, using an adjusted formula that weighed multiple factors, including a film's release year and number of reviews.\r\nPeter Debruge of Variety praised the ensemble cast as well as Wilde's direction, calling the film \"the best high school buddy comedy since Superbad\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"hilarious, blazingly paced teen comedy.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a \"refreshingly original take on the raunchy coming-of-age comedy\" and praising Feldstein and Dever's chemistry. Alissa Wilkinson of Vox awarded the film a score of four out of five, writing that the \"memorably relatable\" Booksmart is also a \"delightful reminder that growing up is about realizing nobody's a stereotype\".\r\nLinda Holmes of NPR gave an especially favorable review, calling the film \"a humane and heartfelt film without a mean bone in its figurative body\". Vulture's Emily Yoshida also favorably wrote that it \"manages to be inclusive and progressive, without being precious about anything or sacrificing an ounce of humor\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times regarded the film as \"sharp but not mean, warm without feeling too soft or timid\", and referring to Feldstein and Dever as \"a classic comedy duo\". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal deemed Booksmart a \"prodigy\", stating that no film that was \"funnier, smarter, quicker or more joyous has graced the big screen in a long time.\"\r\nAccolades\r\nBooksmart was included on 68 critics' top-ten lists, and on two lists was ranked in first place.",

Silberman particularly credited the complimentary language the characters use to Feldstein, who frequently posted \"I have no breath\" to Instagram.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began in May 2018 around the San Fernando Valley.</p><p>Wilde and production designer Katie Byron decorated the bedrooms seen in the film, including with trophies and depictions of prominent American women Michelle Obama and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p><p>The animated dolls sequence was created over five months by a team of thirty people. Wilde had voiced a character on the series Bojack Horseman and contacted ShadowMachine the animation studio behind Bojack to create the sequence. Due to script rewrites parts of the animated scene involving a Roomba and a scene showing glitter vomit, were cut from the film.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>It had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2019. It was released wide in the United States on May 24, 2019. It was also released in France on Netflix the same day.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Booksmart was released on digital download on August 20, 2019, and on DVD and Blu-ray on September 3, 2019.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>Booksmart grossed $22.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $24.9 million.</p><p>In the United States and Canada, Booksmart was released alongside Aladdin and Brightburn, and was projected to gross around $12 million from 2,505 theaters in its four-day opening weekend. The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $875,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up underperforming, debuting to just $6.9 million (a four-day total of $8.7 million), finishing in sixth place. Industry publications insisted that although the targeted young female demographic did turn out to the film, it should have begun with a limited release and expanded, similar to the R-rated, female-led high school comedy Lady Bird in 2017, and that Booksmart failed to stand out in the crowded marketplace. In its second weekend the film made $3.3 million, dropping 52% and finishing in eighth.</p><p>The film's largest market outside North America was the United Kingdom, where it grossed around US$1.8 million (\u00a31.5 million) after seven weeks in theaters.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 357 reviews, with an average rating of 8.28/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Fast-paced, funny, and fresh, Booksmart does the seemingly impossible by adding a smart new spin to the coming-of-age comedy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 80%. In December 2018, Rotten Tomatoes named Booksmart the #1 comedy of the decade on the site, using an adjusted formula that weighed multiple factors, including a film's release year and number of reviews.</p><p>Peter Debruge of Variety praised the ensemble cast as well as Wilde's direction, calling the film \"the best high school buddy comedy since Superbad\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"hilarious, blazingly paced teen comedy.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a \"refreshingly original take on the raunchy coming-of-age comedy\" and praising Feldstein and Dever's chemistry. Alissa Wilkinson of Vox awarded the film a score of four out of five, writing that the \"memorably relatable\" Booksmart is also a \"delightful reminder that growing up is about realizing nobody's a stereotype\".</p><p>Linda Holmes of NPR gave an especially favorable review, calling the film \"a humane and heartfelt film without a mean bone in its figurative body\". Vulture's Emily Yoshida also favorably wrote that it \"manages to be inclusive and progressive, without being precious about anything or sacrificing an ounce of humor\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times regarded the film as \"sharp but not mean, warm without feeling too soft or timid\", and referring to Feldstein and Dever as \"a classic comedy duo\". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal deemed Booksmart a \"prodigy\", stating that no film that was \"funnier, smarter, quicker or more joyous has graced the big screen in a long time.\"</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>Booksmart was included on 68 critics' top-ten lists, and on two lists was ranked in first place.</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"References\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><td><span>Austin Film Critics Association</span></td><td>January 6, 2020</td><td>Best First Film</td><td><i>Booksmart</i></td><td style=\"background: #99FF99;
