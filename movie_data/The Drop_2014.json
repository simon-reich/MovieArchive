Marvin Stipler (James Gandolfini) ceded ownership of the bar years earlier to Chechen mobsters and now operates it with Bob as a 'drop' for illegal takings. Marv ridicules Bob and some patrons for commemorating the 10th anniversary of the murder of a man named Richie Whelan.\r\nOn his way home, Bob finds a battered pit bull pup abandoned in a household garbage can. While rescuing it, he meets Nadia (Noomi Rapace), a resident of the house. Bob leaves the dog in her care until he can decide whether to adopt him.\r\nWhen the bar is robbed by two masked gunmen, Marv is annoyed that Bob told investigating Detective Torres (John Ortiz) about one of the gunmen wearing a broken watch. Torres has seen Bob before at the church they have both attended regularly for some time. He is intrigued by Bob's reluctance to take Holy Communion. (Though this is not said explicitly, Torres would understand this to mean Bob is in a state of mortal sin for which he has not confessed.) Chechen thug Chovka (Michael Aronov) later threatens Marv and Bob and tells them that they must make up for the stolen money. Marv later meets with one of the perpetrators, Fitz (James Frecheville), revealing that he orchestrated the robbery. A later discussion between Marv and his sister, Dottie (Ann Dowd), reveals Marv\u2019s motive is to continue payments for his father\u2019s life support.\r\nBob decides to keep the dog and names him Rocco, all the while bonding with Nadia, who agrees to care for the dog whenever Bob tends to the bar. Nadia has scars on her neck that she reveals are self-inflicted from when she used to have a drug problem. While walking Rocco in a park a man, Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts), approaches Bob and comments about Rocco. Deeds later appears at Bob's house and provides proof that he is the actual owner and admits to beating and abandoning him. He demands Rocco be returned before he raises the matter with the police.\r\nLater, Bob and Marv find a bag at the bar, containing a severed arm with a broken watch together with the stolen money. Bob is unnerved when Deeds appears in the bar and reveals he is friends with Nadia. Marv informs Bob that Deeds is a dangerous thug who claims to have killed Richie Whelan. When Bob confronts Nadia, she admits that she and Deeds used to date. Bob and Marv return the money to the Chechens, who in turn inform them that the bar will be the drop site for the night of the Super Bowl.\r\nMarv tries to convince Fitz to rob the bar again on the night of the Super Bowl. When Fitz refuses because he is scared, Marv kills him. Marv then recruits Deeds to rob the bar. Bob is later confronted by Deeds, who demands $10,000 or else he will take Rocco, starve him, and then beat him again. When Marv informs Bob that he will be calling in sick on the day of the Super Bowl, Bob becomes suspicious and warns him to not do something desperate \"that we can't clean up this time\". On Super Bowl night, with Rocco in tow, Bob takes $10,000 hidden in his basement and hides it behind the bar counter, with a pistol.\r\nDeeds breaks into Nadia's home and forces her to go to the bar with him to watch the Super Bowl. Elsewhere, Marv lines his car trunk with plastic before parking and waiting near the bar, watching various mobsters drop off money throughout the night.\r\nEventually the bar clears except for Deeds and Nadia. Deeds refuses Bob's offer of $10,000 for Rocco, then threatens to kill Nadia if he does not open the time lock safe during the window available at 2 a.m. While they wait, Bob tells a story about Marv when he was a loan shark and how he used to skim off the Chechens. Bob once killed a customer who had hit a huge casino jackpot, using the money to replace Marv's thefts from the Chechens, and Bob disposed of the body in his heating oil tank with lye and laundry detergent. He reveals to Deeds and Nadia that the victim was Richie Whelan, whom Deeds has always taken credit for killing. Bob then draws his gun and shoots Deeds in the neck and then in the face at point-blank range. When a terrified Nadia asks if she can leave, Bob explains that although things go on all around him, he is not a part of it.\r\nThe Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and collect the money from the drop. Chovka indicates to Bob that he was aware of Marv's deceit, and Marv is shot to death in his car while waiting near the bar. Chovka accepts that Bob played no part in the robbery and provides him ownership of the bar as a reward. In a voice-over, internal monologue, Bob reflects on his feelings of remorse for the murder of Whelan and his fear and sadness that his sins have doomed him to eternal loneliness.\r\nDet. Torres visits Bob at the bar to offer condolences over Marv's death, which Bob attributes to a carjacking gone wrong, while Torres believes it to be an execution. Torres asks Bob if he has seen Deeds as he has been reported missing and was last seen at the bar, just as Whelan had been years earlier. Torres tells Bob of the tie between Deeds and Whelan in that Deeds always took credit for Whelan's death, but was in a psychiatric ward the night Whelan went missing. Torres then insinuates that Bob is responsible for both Deeds' and Whelan's disappearance by saying \"No one ever sees you coming, do they, Bob?\"\r\nLater, Bob visits Nadia and, while acknowledging her departure was interpreted as her staying away, asks her if she wants to see him again. Nadia offers to take a walk with him and Rocco and goes to get her coat, while Bob and Rocco wait outside. After a few moments of apprehensive silence, Bob hears the door jingle and shows a small smile as footsteps approach from off-screen.

When a terrified Nadia asks if she can leave, Bob explains that although things go on all around him, he is not a part of it.</p><p>The Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and collect the money from the drop. Chovka indicates to Bob that he was aware of Marv's deceit, and Marv is shot to death in his car while waiting near the bar. Chovka accepts that Bob played no part in the robbery and provides him ownership of the bar as a reward. In a voice-over, internal monologue, Bob reflects on his feelings of remorse for the murder of Whelan and his fear and sadness that his sins have doomed him to eternal loneliness.</p><p>Det. Torres visits Bob at the bar to offer condolences over Marv's death, which Bob attributes to a carjacking gone wrong, while Torres believes it to be an execution. Torres asks Bob if he has seen Deeds as he has been reported missing and was last seen at the bar, just as Whelan had been years earlier. Torres tells Bob of the tie between Deeds and Whelan in that Deeds always took credit for Whelan's death, but was in a psychiatric ward the night Whelan went missing. Torres then insinuates that Bob is responsible for both Deeds' and Whelan's disappearance by saying \"No one ever sees you coming, do they, Bob?\"</p><p>Later, Bob visits Nadia and, while acknowledging her departure was interpreted as her staying away, asks her if she wants to see him again. Nadia offers to take a walk with him and Rocco and goes to get her coat, while Bob and Rocco wait outside. After a few moments of apprehensive silence, Bob hears the door jingle and shows a small smile as footsteps approach from off-screen. (The ending was re-written as more ambiguous at the suggestion of Hardy.)</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Tom Hardy as Bob Saginowski</li><li>Noomi Rapace as Nadia Dunn</li><li>James Gandolfini as Marvin \"Cousin Marv\" Stipler</li><li>Matthias Schoenaerts as Eric Deeds</li><li>John Ortiz as Detective Evandro Torres</li><li>Elizabeth Rodriguez as Detective Romsey</li><li>Michael Aronov as Chovka Umarov</li><li>Morgan Spector as Andre</li><li>Michael Esper as Rardy Bernard</li><li>Ross Bickell as Father Regan</li><li>James Frecheville as Fitz</li><li>Tobias Segal as Briele</li><li>Patricia Squire as Millie</li><li>Ann Dowd as Dottie Stipler</li><li>Chris Sullivan as Jimmy</li><li>Jeremy Bobb as Stevie</li></ul><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>The Drop opened in 809 theaters in North America and grossed $4,104,552, with an average of $5,074 per theater and ranking #6 at the box office.
