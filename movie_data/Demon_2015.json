Piotr speaks Polish awkwardly, remembering more from his ancestors than from personal experience. He moves into a run-down large rural estate previously owned by Zaneta's grandfather.\r\nWhile digging in the yard with a backhoe right before the wedding, Piotr finds a skeleton, which at first he keeps quiet about. He is increasingly haunted by the vision of a woman in a wedding dress - Hana. During the wedding reception this vision draws closer and closer to him, and he has apparent seizures. He is eventually possessed by Hana, the woman in the dress. Zaneta's family is well-to-do, and they want to keep his breakdown quiet from the rest of the wedding guests, so they distract their guests with vodka and loud music while locking Piotr in the basement, first with a doctor, then a priest. Finally, the \"teacher\" (Wlodzimierz Press, who appears to be the only surviving Jewish resident of the town pre-war), realizes that Piotr is speaking Yiddish, and that he is possessed by the spirit of Hana, a lovely Jewish girl he knew before the war who suddenly disappeared.\r\nThe film is a re-telling of a classic dybbuk story and also an allegory for Polish-Jewish relations before and after the war.

He added that \"the distastrous reception is drenched in vodka just like the banquet displayed in Wojciech Smarzowski's The Wedding but purged from any black comedy\". Jake Dee from Arrow in the Head rated the film a score of 8/10, writing, \"Shot with a steady and sure-handed formalistic lens, played with credible pathos by all involved, belled with a quizzically unnerving score - despite the humor hampering the horror at times - Demon is a bold and balefully bedeviling Polish delight!\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's cinematography, and called it \" A bravura testament to a talent silenced far too soon.\".
