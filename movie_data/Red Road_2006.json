It is revealed that he is Clyde Henderson, a prisoner who has been released early for good behaviour but will be back in prison immediately if he steps out of line. She begins stalking Clyde, tracking him on the CCTV monitors and gathering information about him. She follows Clyde to a cafe, and later learns he is throwing a party at the apartment he shares with fellow ex-con Stevie. She gains entry to the party and begins exchanging looks with a drunk Clyde. They dance, but she makes an excuse and runs out of the apartment.\r\nAfter spotting Clyde on CCTV heading to a local bar, she goes there and sees him break up a fight between Stevie and another man. Stevie and his girlfriend return to Clyde's apartment, while Clyde initiates a conversation with Jackie before inviting her back to the apartment too. Clyde reveals he has a daughter, with whom he regrets he has lost contact. Clyde and Jackie have sex, but she runs from the bedroom and stages rape, striking her face with a stone and fleeing from the apartment block in view of the CCTV cameras. The police identify Clyde as the rapist and Jackie watches the arrest on CCTV, and a few moments later sees Clyde's daughter approach the apartment block. Later, Stevie gains entry to Jackie's home and demands to know why she has falsely accused Clyde. Jackie reveals that Clyde killed her husband and daughter.\r\nJackie relents and tells the police she wishes to withdraw the accusation of rape. After Clyde's release, Jackie confronts him and they argue: Clyde describes the road traffic accident that killed Jackie's husband and daughter, and she reveals that her last words to her daughter were harsh. She tells Clyde that his daughter tried to reach him on the day of his arrest, and they go their separate ways.\r\nCast\r\nKate Dickie as Jackie Morrison\r\nTony Curran as Clyde Henderson\r\nMartin Compston as Stevie\r\nNatalie Press as April\r\nPaul Higgins as Avery\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review-aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 88% based on 88 reviews, for an average rating of 7.3/10, the critical consensus stating: \"Red Road director Andrea Arnold skillfully parses out just enough plot details at a time to keep the audience engrossed in this seductive thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nAccolades\r\n2006 Cannes Jury Prize\r\nBAFTA Scotland 2006 \u2013 Best Screenplay\r\nBAFTA Scotland 2006 \u2013 Best Actress in a Scottish Film (Kate Dickie)\r\nBAFTA Scotland 2006 \u2013 Best Actor in a Scottish Film (Tony Curran)\r\nBAFTA Scotland 2006 \u2013 Best Director\r\nBAFTA Scotland 2006 \u2013 Best Film\r\nLondon Film Festival 2006, Sutherland Trophy awarded to \"the director of the most original and imaginative first feature film\"",
