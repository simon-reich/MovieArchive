The film opened across New Zealand on 31 March 2016. The film received a limited North American release on 24 June 2016. The film received critical acclaim, with many critics highlighting Dennison and Neill's performances and chemistry.\r\nPlot\r\nRicky Baker, a juvenile delinquent who was abandoned by his mother, is taken by child welfare services officer Paula and police officer Andy, to live in a remote farm with foster mother Bella Faulkner and her husband, the cantankerous southern man Hec. Hec is remote, but Bella quickly manages to break through Ricky's defensive shell by taking him hunting and giving him a dog for his 13th birthday, which he names Tupac after his idol Tupac Shakur.\r\nWhen Bella suddenly dies and Hec tells Ricky that child services will take him back, Ricky ineptly fakes his suicide by burning a barn and runs away into the bush with Tupac, where he is completely unable to cope and gets lost. Hec finds him easily but breaks his ankle in a fall, forcing the two to camp for a period of time. The authorities meanwhile have found the house empty and the barn burnt down, and come to the conclusion that the bereaved and mentally unstable Hec has abducted Ricky. The impression is strengthened after an encounter with three foolish hunters who get the idea that Hec is molesting Ricky. Hec reveals to Ricky that he has served prison time for manslaughter and is illiterate. Ricky, in turn, says his only friend in foster care has died and that his only options are risking the same fate in the foster system, or serve time in juvenile prison. The pair agree to disappear into the bush.\r\nA national manhunt ensues, and the two slowly bond while working together to escape arrest. Upon finding another hut, they encounter an unconscious, diabetic ranger. Ricky leaves to find help and runs into a girl his age named Kahu. She takes him back to her house and introduces him to her dad. Ricky stays the night and returns the next morning to the hut where Hec was supposed to be. Ricky finds the place to be swarming with police, led by Paula. Ricky runs away. He later encounters Paula and Andy in the bush, separated by a ravine. Paula attempts to bribe Ricky, asking him to say that Hec was a sex offender. In return, she tells him that he will not ever go to juvenile prison. Ricky declines and runs away. Ricky catches up to Hec by remembering the survival strategies Hec taught him, and they continue their travels. They encounter a wild boar that mortally wounds Hec's dog Zag, forcing Hec to euthanize him. Ricky reveals he has been carrying Bella's ashes and originally planned to deliver them to \"where the earth wets the cloak of the sky,\" as per her wishes. They bury Zag and scatter Bella's ashes into a remote waterfall high in a mountain range. Ricky and Hec find a man living out on his own called Psycho Sam. Sam lets them stay the night. After five months of surviving in the wilderness and several close calls, they are finally caught following a car and helicopter chase, and Ricky accidentally shoots Hec. Hec gets remanded and Ricky is taken in by Kahu's family.\r\nAfter Hec's release from jail, Ricky, with his new foster family's permission, returns to the bush with Hec to photograph the huia, an extinct bird they had re-discovered during their time on the run.\r\nCast\r\nSam Neill as Hector Faulkner\r\nJulian Dennison as Ricky Baker\r\nRima Te Wiata as Bella Faulkner\r\nRachel House as Paula Hall, a child welfare worker\r\nRhys Darby as Psycho Sam\r\nOscar Kightley as Andy, a police officer\r\nStan Walker as Ron\r\nTioreore Ngatai-Melbourne as Kahu\r\nTroy Kingi as TK\r\nCohen Holloway as Hugh\r\nTaika Waititi as the Minister\r\nProduction\r\nWaititi first began to adapt the book Wild Pork and Watercress in 2005, and completed multiple different drafts. The early drafts stayed true to the book. However, later versions departed from it in several ways. Julian Dennison was cast by Waititi from earlier work they did together on a commercial.\r\nThe film had a budget of approximately NZ$4.5 million, of which $2 million came from the New Zealand Film Commission.\r\nThe film was shot over 5 weeks, in locations including the Central Plateau and the Wait\u0101kere Ranges. Almost the entire film was shot using a single camera.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on 22 January 2016 and was released in cinemas on 31 March 2016 in New Zealand by Madman Entertainment and The Orchard. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in America on 25 October 2016 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\r\nThe soundtrack by Moniker was released on 8 April 2016 by Majestical Pictures Ltd.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe film grossed NZ$1,263,000 in New Zealand on its opening weekend, the highest grossing opening weekend for a New Zealand film, ahead of What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?'s $912,000 record in 1999. It has become the highest grossing New Zealand film, making over NZ$12 million.\r\nInternationally, as of October 2016, the film has grossed A$10,935,319 in Australia, US$507,380 in the UK and US$5,137,201 in North America.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Hunt for the Wilderpeople received a score of 96%, based on 195 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The charmingly offbeat Hunt for the Wilderpeople unites a solid cast, a talented filmmaker, and a poignant, funny, deeply affecting message.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nIn his review, Hamish Popplestone remarked: \"Though both flawed, Neill's and Dennison's characters are so, so charming on-screen and are fully apt at weaving through the dramatic, comedic, and sad points of the script.\" Empire magazine named Hunt for the Wilderpeople the number one film for 2016.",
