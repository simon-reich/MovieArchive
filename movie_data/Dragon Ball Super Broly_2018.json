It is the twentieth Dragon Ball feature film overall, the third film produced with Toriyama's direct involvement, and the first to carry the Dragon Ball Super branding.\r\nSet after the events of the Universe Survival Saga depicted in Dragon Ball Super, the film follows series protagonists Goku and Vegeta as they encounter a powerful Saiyan name Broly. In the beginning, it tells the history of the Saiyans and the background story of these three Saiyans with different destinies connected to the turbulent period of their race, and later resulting in a massive fight between them.\r\nThe film represents the first appearance of a reworked iteration of Broly in the primary Dragon Ball series continuity, following the character's appearances in the films Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan (1993), Broly \u2013 Second Coming (1994), and Bio-Broly (1994). Having received positive reviews from critics, Dragon Ball Super: Broly is the highest-grossing Dragon Ball film ever, the highest-grossing anime film of 2018, and one of the highest-grossing anime films of all time.\r\nA sequel is currently in development.\r\nPlot\r\nForty-one years ago, the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta is ruled by the forces of King Cold, who delegates their command to his son Frieza. King Vegeta, leader of the Saiyans, believes his son Prince Vegeta is a prodigy destined to liberate their people and rule the universe. He learns of Broly, a Saiyan baby born with an abnormal power level exceeding that of his son, and exiles Broly to the distant planet Vampa. Broly and his father Paragus, who goes after his son, are stranded on Vampa after their ships are damaged. Paragus vows to raise Broly as a mighty warrior to exact revenge on King Vegeta.\r\nFive years later, a low-class Saiyan warrior named Bardock becomes suspicious of Frieza and sends his son Kakarot (later named Goku) to Earth. His suspicions are confirmed when Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta after learning of a legend about a Legendary Super Saiyan who could one day defeat him. The Saiyan race is eradicated, except for Broly and Paragus, Goku and his brother Raditz, Vegeta and his comrade Nappa, and Vegeta's brother Tarble.\r\nIn the present day, Goku and Vegeta train on an island with Bulma, Bulla, Beerus, and Whis. Bulma is contacted by Trunks, who informs her that six of the Dragon Balls have been stolen by Frieza's soldiers. Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Whis travel to the Arctic to find the seventh Dragon Ball before Frieza can retrieve it. Meanwhile, Broly and Paragus are rescued from Vampa by Cheelai and Lemo, two low-class soldiers in Frieza's army searching for recruits. They are brought to Frieza, who recruits them to help him defeat Goku and Vegeta. The two groups come face-to-face in the Arctic, where Paragus orders Broly to attack Vegeta.\r\nBroly fights Vegeta and then Goku, growing stronger as the fight goes on and catching up to their Super Saiyan God forms. Goku overpowers Broly with Super Saiyan Blue and Frieza responds by murdering Paragus, triggering the awakening of Broly's Super Saiyan powers. He overwhelms Goku and Vegeta with his new power, so they trick him into attacking Frieza instead and then teleport to Piccolo's location. Goku and Piccolo teach Vegeta how to use the Fusion Dance technique; about an hour later, after two failed attempts, Goku and Vegeta successfully fuse into Gogeta and teleport back to the battlefield. Gogeta turns Super Saiyan and engages in a beam clash with Broly, which shatters the fabric of reality and sends the two into another dimension. Gogeta dominates the fight until an infuriated Broly powers up even further into his Legendary Super Saiyan form. This allows Broly to regain the advantage, until Gogeta powers up into Super Saiyan Blue, allowing him to dominate the fight once again. The two then clash even more violently, breaking through multiple dimensions, before arriving back in the real world.\r\nGogeta defeats Broly and is about to obliterate him with a powerful energy wave, but Cheelai and Lemo, who had formed a friendship with Broly, summon Shenron with the Dragon Balls and use their wish to transport Broly back to Vampa. Frieza retreats, promising to return another time. Goku later meets with Broly, Cheelai, and Lemo on Vampa, wishing to be friends and providing them with various survival supplies from Capsule Corp, while also hoping to spar with Broly again and offering to teach him how to control his power.\r\nVoice cast\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nThe film is produced by Toei Animation.

In a 5 out of 5 stars review by Stuff, it was considered as the \"best Dragon Ball film\" with the only prominent critical point that \"there are certain scenes where it transitions between 2D animation and 3D ... which can disrupt the flow of it all\". Ollie Barder writing for Forbes, stated that the \"only real criticism at this point is that after this solid narrative starting setup, we have a pretty hefty time jump to where we are post-Dragon Ball Super. Considering the depth and breadth of the story between these points of time, it would have been nice to have a bit more exposition to help with the pacing. However, that said, this is already a long movie and we all know that we have a massive fight to look forward to\". Allegra Frank of Polygon concluded that the movie \"gets the fundamentals of Dragon Ball extremely right, no matter where you're coming in from\", with \"no grand statements to be made in Dragon Ball Super: Broly, and more amusement than anxiety\".\r\nAccolades\r\nHome media\r\nOn April 16, 2019, Funimation released to the North American market the package of Blu-ray discs, DVD and digital combo of the film.

In a 5 out of 5 stars review by Stuff, it was considered as the \"best Dragon Ball film\" with the only prominent critical point that \"there are certain scenes where it transitions between 2D animation and 3D ... which can disrupt the flow of it all\". Ollie Barder writing for Forbes, stated that the \"only real criticism at this point is that after this solid narrative starting setup, we have a pretty hefty time jump to where we are post-Dragon Ball Super. Considering the depth and breadth of the story between these points of time, it would have been nice to have a bit more exposition to help with the pacing. However, that said, this is already a long movie and we all know that we have a massive fight to look forward to\". Allegra Frank of Polygon concluded that the movie \"gets the fundamentals of Dragon Ball extremely right, no matter where you're coming in from\", with \"no grand statements to be made in Dragon Ball Super: Broly, and more amusement than anxiety\".</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"Reference(s)\">Ref(s)</abbr></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Japan Academy Prize</span></th><td rowspan=\"1\">March 1, 2019</td><td><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Animation of the Year</span></td><td rowspan=\"2\"><i>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</i></td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td><td style=\"text-align:center;\"></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Google Play Users\u2019 Choice Awards</span></th><td rowspan=\"1\">December 3, 2019</td><td>Users\u2019 Choice Movie</td><td style=\"background: #FFD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"partial table-partial\">Pending</td><td style=\"text-align:center;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><h3>Home media</h3><p>On April 16, 2019, Funimation released to the North American market the package of Blu-ray discs, DVD and digital combo of the film.
