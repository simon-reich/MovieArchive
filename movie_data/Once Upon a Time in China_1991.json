When Aunt Yee arrives back from America totally westernised, Wong Fei-Hung assumes the role of her protector. This proves to be difficult when his martial arts school and local militia become involved in fierce battles with foreign and local government. As violence escalates even Aunt Yee has to question her new western ideals, but is it possible to fight guns with Kung Fu?",

The Once Upon a Time in China films were among Jet Li's best known hits at that time.\r\nOverview\r\nWith Chinese folk hero of Cantonese ethnicity, Wong Fei-hung, as the main character, the films deal with the positive and negative effects of Western imperialism in China during the late Qing Dynasty. The second film features as a supporting character Sun Yat-sen, a revolutionary leader and founding father of the Chinese republic. Unlike the majority of Hong Kong action films, the Once Upon a Time in China series is clearly politicised. However, even with its clear showcase of Chinese nationalism, it also displays the inevitable nature of accepting western cultures, and the progression of China into the \"modern\" century. This theme is repeated through various actions of the characters, but prominently displayed through the character Master Yim in the first movie. He is a Kung-Fu master, but the likes of him are dwindling and barely making a livelihood. Once, he boasts that his Kung-Fu can even withstand bullets. In irony, he is killed by the onslaught of bullets fired by American soldiers. In his last words, he tells Wong Fei-Hung, \"Martial arts cannot win against guns...\" His character represents the dying of old traditions, and the begrudging abandonment of hand-to-hand combat.\r\nFilms\r\nOnce Upon a Time in China (1991)\r\nOnce Upon a Time in China II (1992)\r\nOnce Upon a Time in China III (1992)\r\nOnce Upon a Time in China IV (1993)\r\nOnce Upon a Time in China V (1994)\r\nTV Series (1995-1996)\r\nOnce Upon a Time in China and America (1997)\r\nMusic\r\nThe theme song of the Once Upon a Time in China series is based on the Ming Dynasty folk song \"Under the General's Orders\"; the version used in the films is titled \"A Man of Determination\" and was written by Wong Jim.\r\nThe Cantonese version of the theme song is sung by George Lam and the Mandarin version is performed by Jackie Chan.\r\nThe theme song has long been associated with the Wong Fei-hung legend, appearing in some form in many early films about him. It was used in the 1978 film Drunken Master, starring Jackie Chan, which also had Wong Fei-hung as the main character. It also was notably used in the 1983 film Winners and Sinners, starring Sammo Hung. It was played in a market scene whilst the Five Lucky Stars are watching two men demonstrating the beneficial effects of their medicines and their martial arts stances, obviously in reference to Wong Fei-hung.\r\nThe theme song was also sampled by Ninja Tune artist Quincy for a track titled \"Bruce Lee MC\", which can be found on the Xen Cuts compilation album. The track also contains samples of Bruce Lee's fight vocalisations.\r\nCast\r\nHome media\r\nIn addition to the various individual DVD releases, the first three films in the series have been released in a number of collection box sets.\r\nOn 17 July 2001, Columbia Tri-Star / Sony released the films in the US in a two-disc box set, with the second disc being double-sided, containing Once Upon a Time in China II on one side and Once Upon a Time in China III on the other. In creating the discs, Colombia took a non-anamorphic master and interpolated it to make it anamorphic. The films in this release feature Cantonese and Mandarin soundtracks, with English, Spanish and French subtitle options.\r\nColumbia Tri-Star later re-released the \"trilogy\" in a three disc version of the box set.\r\nOn 7 April 2003, the films were released by Hong Kong Legends. This release contained extras including interviews. The first film featured an audio commentary by Bey Logan and Mark King. The second and third films featured commentaries by Logan on his own. The films are presented in their original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, with Cantonese audio and English subtitles, as well as English dub tracks.\r\nIn 2004, the trilogy was released in remastered version in Hong Kong by Joy Sales / Fortune Star's under their \"Legendary Collection\" banner.\r\nHong Kong-based company Kam & Ronson Enterprise have announced that they will release the first three films on Blu-ray Disc in June 2009. The first film was released on 18 September 2009.\r\nImitators\r\nAs imitation was relatively common in the Hong Kong film industry, Once Upon a Time in China quickly gained mimics. Whilst these films also focused on Wong Fei-hung, they were not part of the series, and had different cast members and directors. They include:\r\nOnce Upon a Chinese Hero, directed by Wu Ma and starring Yuen Biao as Lau Zhai. In some releases this had the alternative titles Kickboxer and Once Upon A Time in China 6: Kickboxer.\r\nOnce Upon a Time a Hero in China, directed by Lee Lik-Chi and starring Alan Tam, Eric Tsang and Simon Yam.\r\nOnce Upon a Time a Hero in China II, a sequel to Once Upon a Time a Hero in China, directed by Lee Lik-Chi and starring Alan Tam and Eric Tsang.\r\nGreat Hero from China, directed by Hwang Jang Lee and starring Chin Kar-lok and Lam Ching Ying.\r\nHowever, one imitator had more direct links with the original series, Last Hero in China (\u9ec3\u98db\u9d3b\u4e4b\u9435\u96de\u9b25\u8708\u86a3). This film was released in 1993 after the original Once Upon a Time in China trilogy. It is derivative of these films, and unlike other imitation films, it can be considered a spin-off or parody to some extent. It was directed by Wong Jing in place of Tsui Hark. The film's action director was Yuen Woo-ping and once again it starred Jet Li as Wong Fei-hung. However it differs greatly in tone from the Once Upon a Time in China series, containing stronger elements of violence and broader slapstick comedy.",
