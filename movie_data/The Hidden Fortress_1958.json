En Route they encounter the remnants of the defeated tribe that consists, most notably, of a famous General and a Princess who are hiding out in a fortress in the mountains. General Rokurota Makabe and Princess Yuki need to escape into allied territory with their large supply of gold so that they can rebuild their shattered clan. To do this the Peasants are tricked into helping them, with the promise that they will receive a large share of the gold when the destination is reached. Along the way, the General's prowess is put to the test as he must guide the 4, and later 5 with the inclusion of a freed slave, through close encounters with the pursuing enemy, and out of difficult situations the bumbling peasants manage to get them into.",

Planning to evade the Yamana soldiers who are preventing refugees and defeated Akizuki clansmen from crossing the frontier to Hayakawa, the peasants encounter a mysterious man who takes them to a hidden Akizuki fortress. Unbeknownst to them, the man is a general of the defeated Akizuki clan, Makabe Rokur\u014dta. Although Rokur\u014dta was planning on killing the peasants, on hearing their plan, he decides it is so ingenious, he will let them live. They will travel to Yamana itself and then pass into Hayakawa through a different border. Rokur\u014dta decides, without revealing anything to the peasants, to move the Akizuki Princess Yuki to Hayakawa, whose lord is an ally of the Akizuki clan.\r\nRokur\u014dta escorts Princess Yuki and what remains of her family's gold to Hayakawa, with Matashichi and Tahei traveling with them. In order to keep her identity secret, Yuki poses as a mute so that she doesn't inadvertently speak in the usual mode characteristic of a noblewoman. During their travels, the peasants impede their progress and sometimes try to seize the gold. They are later joined by a farmer\u2019s daughter, whom they acquire from an innkeeper.\r\nThey avoid being captured on one occasion by Rokur\u014dta killing four soldiers of a Yamana patrol, including two soldiers Rokur\u014dta has to pursue on horseback. However, Rokur\u014dta ends up in a Yamana camp, where the general in charge is Rokur\u014dta's friendly rival, Hyoe Tadokoro. Tadokoro states that he is sorry he didn't face Rokur\u014dta in battle and decides to have a lance duel, which Rokur\u014dta wins, but Rokur\u014dta refuses to kill Tadokoro. Rokur\u014dta tells Tadokoro they'll meet again and then leaves the camp on horseback to get back to the Princess.\r\nEventually, they are captured by Yamana soldiers close to a post on the Hayakawa border and held prisoner to be executed. In the confusion, Matashichi and Tahei are able to hide and avoid being taken prisoner. Tadokoro comes to identify the prisoners before the soldiers take them to be executed. Tadokoro shows a large face scar and explains it is a result of a beating ordered by the Yamana lord for losing the duel with Rokur\u014dta. The Princess proclaims that, even facing death, she has enjoyed the trip and getting to know humanity's ugliness and beauty closely. The next day as the soldiers start marching the prisoners to be executed, Tadokoro suddenly defects to the Akizuki side with the Princess, Rokur\u014dta and the farmer's daughter. The group manages to escape along with the horses carrying the gold.\r\nAfter the Princess and Rokur\u014dta's escape, Matashichi and Tahei stumble upon the gold which is carried by the horses, but are then arrested by Hayakawa soldiers. The soldiers take the peasants to see the general, whereupon Rokur\u014dta explains Yuki's true identity, and states that all of the gold will be used to restore her family's domain. The peasants are then released, taking a single ry\u014d. Finally, Tahei gives this to Matashichi to protect; but Matashichi allows Tahei to keep it.\r\nCast\r\nToshiro Mifune as General Rokurota Makabe (\u771f\u58c1 \u516d\u90ce\u592a, Makabe Rokurota)\r\nMinoru Chiaki as Tahei (\u592a\u5e73)\r\nKamatari Fujiwara as Matashichi (\u53c8\u4e03)\r\nSusumu Fujita as General Hyoe Tadokoro (\u7530\u6240 \u5175\u885b, Tadokoro Hyoe)\r\nTakashi Shimura as General Izumi Nagakura (\u9577\u5009 \u548c\u6cc9, Nagakura Izumi)\r\nMisa Uehara as Princess Yuki (\u96ea\u59eb, Yuki-hime)\r\nEiko Miyoshi as Yuki's lady-in-waiting\r\nToshiko Higuchi as farmer's daughter bought from slave trader\r\nY\u016b Fujiki as barrier guard\r\nYoshio Tsuchiya as samurai on horse\r\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d as old man in front of sign\r\nK\u014dji Mitsui as pit guard\r\nProduction\r\nThis was Kurosawa's first feature filmed in a widescreen format, Tohoscope, which he continued to use for the next decade.

The soundtrack album comprises 65 tracks.\r\nTracks\r\nAlternative Takes\r\nRelease\r\nThe Hidden Fortress was released theatrically in Japan on December 28, 1958. The film was the highest-grossing film for Toho in 1958, ranking as the fourth overall highest-grossing films in Japan that year. In box-office terms, The Hidden Fortress was Kurosawa\u2019s most successful film, until the 1961 release of Yojimbo.\r\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States by Toho International Col. with English subtitles. It was screened in San Francisco on November 1959 and received a wider release on October 6, 1960 with a 126-minute running time. The film was re-issued in the United States in 1962 with a 90-minute running time. The film which was compared unfavorably to Rashomon and Seven Samurai performed poorly at U. S. box office.\r\nCritical reception\r\nAn article published in The New York Times on January 24, 1962, had the film's review by prominent journalist Bosley Crowther who called The Hidden Fortess a superficial film. He said\r\nHe mentioned that Kurosawa, for all his talent, is as prone to pot boiling as anyone else.\r\nWriting for The Criterion Collection in 1987, David Ehrenstein called it \"one of the greatest action-adventure films ever made\" and a \"fast-paced, witty and visually stunning\" samurai film. According to Ehrenstein:\r\nThe battle on the steps in Chapter 2 (anticipating the climax of Ran) is as visually overwhelming as any of the similar scenes in Griffith's Intolerance. The use of composition in depth in the fortress scene in Chapter 4 is likewise as arresting as the best of Eisenstein or David Lean. Toshiro Mifune's muscular demonstrations of heroic derring-do in the horse-charge scene (Chapter 11) and the scrupulously choreographed spear duel that follows it (Chapter 12) is in the finest tradition of Douglas Fairbanks. Overall, there\u2019s a sense of sheer \"movieness\" to The Hidden Fortress that places it plainly in the ranks of such grand adventure entertainments as Gunga Din, The Thief of Baghdad, and Fritz Lang's celebrated diptych The Tiger of Eschnapur and The Hindu Tomb.\r\nDavid Parkinson of the Empire on a review posted on January 1, 2000, gave the film four out of five stars and wrote \"Somewhat overshadowed by the likes of Seven Samurai, this is a vigorously placed, meticulously staged adventure. It's not top drawer, but still ranks among the best of Kurosawa's minor masterpieces.\"\r\nWriting for The Criterion Collection in 2001, Armond White said \"The Hidden Fortress holds a place in cinema history comparable to John Ford's Stagecoach: It lays out the plot and characters of an on-the-road epic of self-discovery and heroic action. In a now-familiar fashion, Rokur\u014dta and Princess Yuki fight their way to allied territory, accompanied by a scheming, greedy comic duo who get surprised by their own good fortune. Kurosawa always balances valor and greed, seriousness and humor, while depicting the misfortunes of war.\"\r\nUpon the film's UK re-release in 2002, Jamie Russell, reviewing the film for the BBC, said it \"effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy\", calling it \"both cracking entertainment and a wonderful piece of cinema.\"\r\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian made a review on February 1, 2002. According to him:\r\nRevered now as an inspiration for George Lucas, Kurosawa's amiable, forthright epic romance happens on a scorched, rugged landscape which looks quiet a lot like an alien planet. At other times, the movie plays like nothing so much as a roistering comedy western. But it has a cleverly contrived relationship between the principals, including a fantastically brash and virile Toshiro Mifune. The comedy co-exists with a dark view of live's brevity, and Kurosawa devises exhilarating setpieces and captivating images. Arthouse classics aren't usually as welcoming and entertaining as this.\r\n\r\nVariety called it \"a long, interesting, humour-laden picture in medieval Japan\". Performances of the lead actors, Kurosawa's direction and Ichio Yamazaki's camerawork were praised.\r\nThe film has an aggregate of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 critic reviews.\r\nAwards\r\nThe film won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival in 1959. Kinema Junpo awarded Shinobu Hashimoto the award for Best Screenwriter for his work on the film and for Tadashi Imai's Night Drum and Yoshitaro Nomura's Harikomi.\r\nInfluence\r\nGeorge Lucas has acknowledged the heavy influence of The Hidden Fortress on Star Wars, particularly in the technique of telling the story from the perspective of the film's lowliest characters, C-3PO and R2-D2. Lucas's original plot outline for Star Wars also had a strong resemblance to the plot of The Hidden Fortress, which would be reused for The Phantom Menace.\r\nThe Japanese-inspired video game Shogo: Mobile Armor Division features a level called \"The Hidden Fortress\", one of many tributes (including a level called \"High and Low\") to Kurosawa in the game.\r\nRemake\r\nA loose remake entitled Kakushi Toride no San-Akunin: The Last Princess was directed by Shinji Higuchi and released on May 10, 2008.",
