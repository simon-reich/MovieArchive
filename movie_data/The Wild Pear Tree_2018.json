It was also selected as the Turkish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.\r\nPlot\r\nSinan is an aspiring young writer who has just finished college. Returning to his hometown of \u00c7an, he sets about trying to find local funding to publish his debut manuscript, which he calls a \"quirky auto-fiction meta-novel,\" but finds that the locals are uninterested. He also discovers that his eccentric father, Idris, has allowed his gambling addiction to disastrously reduce the family's fortune and stature. Worried about his career prospects and finding himself socially isolated in his rural hometown, Sinan wanders the countryside and engages in a series of testy conversations with various relatives and locals, including an established writer and two Imams who hold differing opinions about religion's place in the modern world.\r\nEventually, disgusted by his father's degenerate gambling and suspecting him of stealing money, Sinan sells his father's beloved dog for the money to have his book published. He then leaves town for his required military service. When he returns, he finds that his father has abandoned his family, and is now living as a rural shepherd. The two reconnect in a friendly conversation where Idris reveals that he has given up his long-running quixotic attempt to dig a well on his arid property, and that he has read and enjoyed Sinan's book (making him the only person who appears to have done so).

        "videoDescription": "A Cinema Guild Release. Opens January 30 at Film Forum (https://bit.ly/2UKbclR).\n\nSinan (Aydin Dogu Demirkol), an aspiring writer, returns home after university hoping to scrape together enough money to publish his first novel. He wanders the town encountering old flames and obstinate gatekeepers and finds his youthful ambition increasingly at odds with the deferred dreams of his gambling-addict father (Murat Cemcir). As his own fantasies mingle with reality, Sinan grapples with the people and the place that have made him who he is.  Following in the great tradition of family dramas like Death of a Salesman and Long Day's Journey Into Night,  The Wild Pear Tree weaves an evocative tale of creative struggle and familial responsibility with inspired performances, sumptuous imagery and surprising bursts of humor. It's one of Nuri Bilge Ceylan's most personal works to date, a film as rich, layered and uncompromising as the novel its headstrong hero is working to publish.",
