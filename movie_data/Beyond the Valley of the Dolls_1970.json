There they find success, but luckily for us, they sink into a cesspool of decadence. This film has a sleeping woman performing on a gun which is in her mouth. It has women posing as men. It has lesbian sex scenes. It is also written by Roger Ebert, who had become friends with Russ Meyer after writing favorable reviews of several of his films.",

The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune.\r\nSusan welcomes Kelly and her friends, even promising a third of her inheritance to her niece, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor, Porter Hall, discredits them as \"hippies\" in an attempt to embezzle her fortune. Undeterred, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that Z-Man becomes their svengali manager, changing their name to The Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.\r\nKelly drifts away from Harris and takes up with Lance Rocke, a high-priced gigolo, who has designs on her inheritance. At first, Harris fends off the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives, but after losing Kelly, he allows Ashley to seduce him. Ashley soon tires of his conventional nature and inability to perform sexually due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris descends further into heavy drug and alcohol use, leading to a fistfight with Lance and a drug-addled one-night stand with Casey which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris. Casey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men's foibles, has a lesbian affair with clothes designer Roxanne, who pressures her to have an abortion.\r\nPetronella has a seemingly enchanted romance with law student Emerson Thorne. After a meet cute at Z-Man's party, they are shown running slow-motion through golden fields and frolicking in a haystack. Their fairy-tale romance frays when Pet sleeps with Randy Black, a violent prize fighter who beats up Emerson and tries to run him down with a car.\r\nSusan Lake is reunited with her former fianc\u00e9 Baxter Wolfe. The Carrie Nations release records and continue to perform successfully, despite constant touring and drug use. Upset at being pushed to the sidelines, Harris attempts suicide by leaping from the rafters of a sound stage during a television appearance by the band. Harris survives the fall, but becomes paraplegic from his injuries.\r\nKelly devotes herself to caring for Harris. Emerson forgives Petronella for her infidelity. Casey and Roxanne have a steamy, intimate romance, but this idyllic existence ends when Z-Man invites Casey, Roxanne, and Lance to a psychedelic-fueled party at his house. After Z-Man tries to seduce Lance, who spurns him, he reveals that he has breasts, meaning he has been a female in drag all this time. Z-Man then goes on a murderous rampage: he beheads Lance with a sword, stabs his servant Otto to death, and shoots Roxanne and Casey, killing them.\r\nResponding to a desperate phone call Casey made shortly before her death, Kelly, Harris, Pet, and Emerson arrive at Z-Man's house and try to subdue him. Petronella is wounded in the melee, which ends in Z-Man's death. Harris is able to move his feet, the start of his recovery from paralysis.\r\nAn epilogue follows, with a preachy, satirical, voice-over monologue and scenes of Kelly and Harris (now in crutches) hiking on a log over a creek, and a final scene with the courthouse wedding of three couples\u2014Kelly and Harris, Pet and Emerson, and Susan and Baxter\u2014with Porter observing from outside the courthouse window.\r\nCast\r\nCast notes\r\nPam Grier has a bit part as a partygoer.\r\nTrina Parks, of James Bond's Diamonds Are Forever has a bit part.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nBeyond the Valley of the Dolls was originally intended as a straightforward sequel to the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls.\r\nJacqueline Susann, author of the novel Valley of the Dolls, had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel The Love Machine. She wrote a treatment and in June 1968 it was reported Fox wanted Dorothy Kingsley to write a screenplay but she was busy on Bracken's World. In November, it was reported that Barbara Parkins would return in the film, but Patty Duke and Sharon Tate would not.\r\nIn June 1969 Fox announced the film would be made in the next 18 months and would come from Irving Manfield Productions. A script was written by Jean Holloway.\r\nRuss Meyer\r\nIn August 1969 Fox announced that the film would no longer be made by Irving Mansfield. Instead they had hired Russ Meyer, whose recent movie Vixen had been a massive commercial success. Holloway's script was discarded and the film critic Roger Ebert took a five-week leave of absence to write a script. Parkins was no longer attached to the film.\r\nMeyer said Richard Zanuck, head of Fox, gave him a weekend to come up with an idea of how it could be done \"stressing budget strongly in line with the whole ideas of making movies more cheaply\" and encouraging him to \"make an R film smashing against an X rating.\"\r\nMeyer wanted to use his own writer, the critic Roger Ebert.\r\nScript\r\nMeyer says he and Ebert wrote a 127-page treatment in 10 days and the script in three weeks. Neither of them had read the novel but they watched the 1967 film and used the same formula: Three young girls come to Hollywood, find fame and fortune, are threatened by sex, violence, and drugs, and either do or do not win redemption,\" according to Ebert. He later added \"We would include some of the sensational elements of the original story- homosexuality, crippling diseases, characters based on \"real\" people, events out of recent headlines- but, again, with flat-out exaggeration.\"\r\nThe script was not only a spoof of the original film, but also, in Ebert's words, \"a satire of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters, and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn't know whether the movie 'knew' it was a comedy\".\r\nEbert said the plot was derived in collaboration \"by creating characters and then working out situations to cover the range of exploitable content we wanted in the film. Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together.\"\r\nMeyer's intention was for the film to \"simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the Sharon Tate murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'\".\r\nEbert later recalled:\r\nAt the time we were working on BVD I didn't really understand how unusual the project was. But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even congnizance) from the Front Office.\r\nMeyer submitted the script to Richard Zanuck at Fox in September and Zanuck greenlit the film.\r\nMeyer said when Fox offered him the film \"I felt like I had pulled off the biggest caper in the world.\"\r\nHe described the film as \"a soap opera for young people, a cornocopia of wild, way-out now entertainment.\"\r\nCharacter influences\r\nRoger Ebert revealed that many of the film's themes and characters were based upon real people and events, but because neither Ebert nor Russ Meyer actually met these people, their characterizations were based on pure speculation.\r\nRonnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell \u2013 The fictional eccentric rock producer turned Carrie Nations manager was loosely based on real-life producer Phil Spector. More than three decades later, Spector was convicted of murder after the body of Lana Clarkson was found at his mansion, which is somewhat reminiscent of the events of the film's climax.\r\nRandy Black \u2013 The heavyweight champ character was loosely based on the real World Heavyweight Champion Muhammad Ali.\r\nThe climactic, violent ending, which was not in the original script, was inspired by the real-life Tate-LaBianca murders perpetrated by the Manson family. The film began production on December 2, 1969, shortly after the murders, which were covered heavily by the media. Valley of the Dolls star Sharon Tate was among the murder victims, as was Jay Sebring. Vocalist Lynn Carey, who was dating Sebring and had been invited to join him the night of the Tate-LaBianca murders, refused his invitation, according to her comments on the DVD extras.\r\nPorter Hall \u2013 This scheming lawyer shares the name of a character actor who often played movie villains.\r\nSusan Lake and Baxter Wolfe were, in an original draft script, Anne Welles and Lyon Burke from Valley of the Dolls. Their back-story stated in BVD (\"He proposed to her but it was the wrong time\", \"It's been three years ...\"), matches the ending of the original. Following Jacqueline Susann's legal-action proceedings against 20th Century Fox, the characters were renamed and recast. Barbara Parkins, who played Anne, was originally under contract to appear in BVD and was disappointed when she was abruptly removed from the project. The special edition DVD features a screen test with Michael Blodgett and Cynthia Myers enacting the bedroom scene between Lance and Kelly. Obviously based on an early script, the dialogue has them make reference to Anne Welles, not Susan Lake, as Kelly's Aunt.\r\nCasting\r\nThe cast was composed almost entirely of unknowns. \"Valley of the Dolls plus my own name will be enough,\" said Meyer.\r\nMeyer said even if Parkins had wanted to do the film they would not have used her. \"She would cost us too much money.\"\r\nCynthia Myers was a playboy playmate hired to play one of the girls who realizes she's a lesbian. \"It's a loving and tender thing,\" Myers said of the film's depiction of her sexuality. \"It's not The Killing of Sister George.\"\r\nEdy Williams was under contract to Fox at the time.\r\nPam Grier made her film debut as an extra in a party scene.\r\nShooting\r\n\"This is a now movie,\" said Meyer. \"It's about what's happening now.\"\r\nMeyer and Ebert kept the costs down by writing \"97 percent of the film\" for existing sets on the Fox backlot.\r\nEbert said that Beyond the Valley of the Dolls seemed \"like a movie that got made by accident when the lunatics took over the asylum\".\r\n\"It was the first time I've made a movie with more than a five man crew,\" said Meyer.\r\nEbert says Meyer \"directed his actors with a poker face, solemnly discussing the motivations behind each scene. Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn't supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material.\"\r\nBecause the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in drag, were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development. As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner, saying \"If the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work.\" Ebert described the resulting tone as \"curious\".\r\nIn 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it:\r\nI think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message.\r\nEditing\r\nUpon its initial release, the film was given an X rating by the MPAA; in 1990, it was reclassified as NC-17. Meyer's response to the original X rating was to attempt to re-edit the film to insert more nudity and sex, but Fox wanted to get the movie released quickly and would not give him the time.\r\nMusic and soundtrack\r\nMost of the film's music was written by Stu Phillips. Phillips adapted Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice for the psychedelic scene at Z-Man's house near the film's end.\r\nMembers of the fictitious Carrie Nations neither sing nor play their own instruments in the film. Vocals for the lip-synced songs were performed by Lynn Carey, a blue-eyed soul singer based in Los Angeles. Carey's voice is showcased on the apocalyptic rocker \"Find It\" (by Stu Phillips and Carey), the earnest folk anthem \"Come With the Gentle People\" (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone), the raunchy R&B of \"Sweet Talking Candyman\" (by Phillips and Stone), the lilting ballad \"In the Long Run\" (by Phillips and Stone), and the soulful strut of \"Look On Up At the Bottom\" (also by Phillips and Stone). She also sings \"Once I had Love\", written by Stu Phillips and herself.\r\nStrawberry Alarm Clock performed their 1967 hit \"Incense and Peppermints\", the mid-tempo rocker \"Girl from the City\" (written by Paul Marshall), and the power pop anthem \"I'm Comin' Home\" (also by Marshall) during the first party scene at Z-Man's house. The film's title song was performed by A&M artists The Sandpipers and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 Come Saturday Morning LP.\r\nDifferent versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties.

The film was directed by Russ Meyer and co-written by Meyer and Roger Ebert.</p><p>Originally intended as a sequel to the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls\u2014\"dolls\" being a slang term for depressant pills or \"downers\"\u2014Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was instead revised as a parody of the commercially successful but critically reviled original.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Three young women\u2014Kelly MacNamara, Casey Anderson, and Petronella \"Pet\" Danforth\u2014perform in a rock band, The Kelly Affair, managed by Harris Allsworth, Kelly's boyfriend. The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune.</p><p>Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, even promising a third of her inheritance to her niece, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor, Porter Hall, discredits them as \"hippies\" in an attempt to embezzle her fortune. Undeterred, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that Z-Man becomes their svengali manager, changing their name to The Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.</p><p>Kelly drifts away from Harris and takes up with Lance Rocke, a high-priced gigolo, who has designs on her inheritance. At first, Harris fends off the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives, but after losing Kelly, he allows Ashley to seduce him. Ashley soon tires of his conventional nature and inability to perform sexually due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris descends further into heavy drug and alcohol use, leading to a fistfight with Lance and a drug-addled one-night stand with Casey which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris. Casey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men's foibles, has a lesbian affair with clothes designer Roxanne, who pressures her to have an abortion.</p><p>Petronella has a seemingly enchanted romance with law student Emerson Thorne. After a meet cute at Z-Man's party, they are shown running slow-motion through golden fields and frolicking in a haystack. Their fairy-tale romance frays when Pet sleeps with Randy Black, a violent prize fighter who beats up Emerson and tries to run him down with a car.</p><p>Susan Lake is reunited with her former fianc\u00e9 Baxter Wolfe. The Carrie Nations release records and continue to perform successfully, despite constant touring and drug use. Upset at being pushed to the sidelines, Harris attempts suicide by leaping from the rafters of a sound stage during a television appearance by the band. Harris survives the fall, but becomes paraplegic from his injuries.</p><p>Kelly devotes herself to caring for Harris. Emerson forgives Petronella for her infidelity. Casey and Roxanne have a steamy, intimate romance, but this idyllic existence ends when Z-Man invites Casey, Roxanne, and Lance to a psychedelic-fueled party at his house. After Z-Man tries to seduce Lance, who spurns him, he reveals that he has breasts, meaning he has been a female in drag all this time. Z-Man then goes on a murderous rampage: he beheads Lance with a sword, stabs his servant Otto to death, and shoots Roxanne and Casey, killing them.</p><p>Responding to a desperate phone call Casey made shortly before her death, Kelly, Harris, Pet, and Emerson arrive at Z-Man's house and try to subdue him. Petronella is wounded in the melee, which ends in Z-Man's death. Harris is able to move his feet, the start of his recovery from paralysis.</p><p>An epilogue follows, with a preachy, satirical, voice-over monologue and scenes of Kelly and Harris (now in crutches) hiking on a log over a creek, and a final scene with the courthouse wedding of three couples\u2014Kelly and Harris, Pet and Emerson, and Susan and Baxter\u2014with Porter observing from outside the courthouse window.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left; vertical-align: top;\"><ul><li><span>Dolly Read</span> as Kelly MacNamara</li><li><span>Cynthia Myers</span> as Casey Anderson</li><li>Marcia McBroom as Petronella Danforth</li><li><span>John LaZar</span> as Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell</li><li><span>Michael Blodgett</span> as Lance Rocke</li><li>David Gurian as Harris Allsworth</li><li><span>Edy Williams</span> as Ashley St. Ives</li></ul><p> </p></td><td style=\"text-align: left; vertical-align: top;\"><ul><li><span>Erica Gavin</span> as Roxanne</li><li><span>Phyllis Davis</span> as Susan Lake</li><li><span>Harrison Page</span> as Emerson Thorne</li><li>Duncan McLeod as Porter Hall</li><li><span>James Iglehart</span> as Randy Black</li><li><span>Charles Napier</span> as Baxter Wolfe</li><li><span>Henry Rowland</span> as Otto</li></ul><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Cast notes</p><ul><li>Pam Grier has a bit part as a partygoer.</li><li>Trina Parks, of James Bond's Diamonds Are Forever has a bit part.</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was originally intended as a straightforward sequel to the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls.</p><p>Jacqueline Susann, author of the novel Valley of the Dolls, had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel The Love Machine. She wrote a treatment and in June 1968 it was reported Fox wanted Dorothy Kingsley to write a screenplay but she was busy on Bracken's World. In November, it was reported that Barbara Parkins would return in the film, but Patty Duke and Sharon Tate would not.</p><p>In June 1969 Fox announced the film would be made in the next 18 months and would come from Irving Manfield Productions. A script was written by Jean Holloway.</p><h4>Russ Meyer</h4><p>In August 1969 Fox announced that the film would no longer be made by Irving Mansfield. Instead they had hired Russ Meyer, whose recent movie Vixen had been a massive commercial success. Holloway's script was discarded and the film critic Roger Ebert took a five-week leave of absence to write a script. Parkins was no longer attached to the film.</p><p>Meyer said Richard Zanuck, head of Fox, gave him a weekend to come up with an idea of how it could be done \"stressing budget strongly in line with the whole ideas of making movies more cheaply\" and encouraging him to \"make an R film smashing against an X rating.\"</p><p>Meyer wanted to use his own writer, the critic Roger Ebert.</p><h4>Script</h4><p>Meyer says he and Ebert wrote a 127-page treatment in 10 days and the script in three weeks. Neither of them had read the novel but they watched the 1967 film and used the same formula: Three young girls come to Hollywood, find fame and fortune, are threatened by sex, violence, and drugs, and either do or do not win redemption,\" according to Ebert. He later added \"We would include some of the sensational elements of the original story- homosexuality, crippling diseases, characters based on \"real\" people, events out of recent headlines- but, again, with flat-out exaggeration.\"</p><p>The script was not only a spoof of the original film, but also, in Ebert's words, \"a satire of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters, and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn't know whether the movie 'knew' it was a comedy\".</p><p>Ebert said the plot was derived in collaboration \"by creating characters and then working out situations to cover the range of exploitable content we wanted in the film. Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together.\"</p><p>Meyer's intention was for the film to \"simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the Sharon Tate murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'\".</p><p>Ebert later recalled:</p><blockquote>At the time we were working on BVD I didn't really understand how unusual the project was. But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even congnizance) from the Front Office.</blockquote><p>Meyer submitted the script to Richard Zanuck at Fox in September and Zanuck greenlit the film.</p><p>Meyer said when Fox offered him the film \"I felt like I had pulled off the biggest caper in the world.\"</p><p>He described the film as \"a soap opera for young people, a cornocopia of wild, way-out now entertainment.\"</p><h4>Character influences</h4><p>Roger Ebert revealed that many of the film's themes and characters were based upon real people and events, but because neither Ebert nor Russ Meyer actually met these people, their characterizations were based on pure speculation.</p><ul><li>Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell \u2013 The fictional eccentric rock producer turned Carrie Nations manager was loosely based on real-life producer Phil Spector. More than three decades later, Spector was convicted of murder after the body of Lana Clarkson was found at his mansion, which is somewhat reminiscent of the events of the film's climax.</li><li>Randy Black \u2013 The heavyweight champ character was loosely based on the real World Heavyweight Champion Muhammad Ali.</li><li>The climactic, violent ending, which was not in the original script, was inspired by the real-life Tate-LaBianca murders perpetrated by the Manson family. The film began production on December 2, 1969, shortly after the murders, which were covered heavily by the media. Valley of the Dolls star Sharon Tate was among the murder victims, as was Jay Sebring. Vocalist Lynn Carey, who was dating Sebring and had been invited to join him the night of the Tate-LaBianca murders, refused his invitation, according to her comments on the DVD extras.</li><li>Porter Hall \u2013 This scheming lawyer shares the name of a character actor who often played movie villains.</li><li>Susan Lake and Baxter Wolfe were, in an original draft script, Anne Welles and Lyon Burke from Valley of the Dolls. Their back-story stated in BVD (\"He proposed to her but it was the wrong time\", \"It's been three years ...\"), matches the ending of the original. Following Jacqueline Susann's legal-action proceedings against 20th Century Fox, the characters were renamed and recast. Barbara Parkins, who played Anne, was originally under contract to appear in BVD and was disappointed when she was abruptly removed from the project. The special edition DVD features a screen test with Michael Blodgett and Cynthia Myers enacting the bedroom scene between Lance and Kelly. Obviously based on an early script, the dialogue has them make reference to Anne Welles, not Susan Lake, as Kelly's Aunt.</li></ul><h4>Casting</h4><p>The cast was composed almost entirely of unknowns. \"Valley of the Dolls plus my own name will be enough,\" said Meyer.</p><p>Meyer said even if Parkins had wanted to do the film they would not have used her. \"She would cost us too much money.\"</p><p>Cynthia Myers was a playboy playmate hired to play one of the girls who realizes she's a lesbian. \"It's a loving and tender thing,\" Myers said of the film's depiction of her sexuality. \"It's not The Killing of Sister George.\"</p><p>Edy Williams was under contract to Fox at the time.</p><p>Pam Grier made her film debut as an extra in a party scene.</p><h4>Shooting</h4><p>\"This is a now movie,\" said Meyer. \"It's about what's happening now.\"</p><p>Meyer and Ebert kept the costs down by writing \"97 percent of the film\" for existing sets on the Fox backlot.</p><p>Ebert said that Beyond the Valley of the Dolls seemed \"like a movie that got made by accident when the lunatics took over the asylum\".</p><p>\"It was the first time I've made a movie with more than a five man crew,\" said Meyer.</p><p>Ebert says Meyer \"directed his actors with a poker face, solemnly discussing the motivations behind each scene. Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn't supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material.\"</p><p>Because the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in drag, were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development. As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner, saying \"If the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work.\" Ebert described the resulting tone as \"curious\".</p><p>In 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it:</p><blockquote>I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message.</blockquote><h4>Editing</h4><p>Upon its initial release, the film was given an X rating by the MPAA; in 1990, it was reclassified as NC-17. Meyer's response to the original X rating was to attempt to re-edit the film to insert more nudity and sex, but Fox wanted to get the movie released quickly and would not give him the time.</p><h4>Music and soundtrack</h4><p>Most of the film's music was written by Stu Phillips. Phillips adapted Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice for the psychedelic scene at Z-Man's house near the film's end.</p><p>Members of the fictitious Carrie Nations neither sing nor play their own instruments in the film. Vocals for the lip-synced songs were performed by Lynn Carey, a blue-eyed soul singer based in Los Angeles. Carey's voice is showcased on the apocalyptic rocker \"Find It\" (by Stu Phillips and Carey), the earnest folk anthem \"Come With the Gentle People\" (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone), the raunchy R&B of \"Sweet Talking Candyman\" (by Phillips and Stone), the lilting ballad \"In the Long Run\" (by Phillips and Stone), and the soulful strut of \"Look On Up At the Bottom\" (also by Phillips and Stone). She also sings \"Once I had Love\", written by Stu Phillips and herself.</p><p>Strawberry Alarm Clock performed their 1967 hit \"Incense and Peppermints\", the mid-tempo rocker \"Girl from the City\" (written by Paul Marshall), and the power pop anthem \"I'm Comin' Home\" (also by Marshall) during the first party scene at Z-Man's house. The film's title song was performed by A&M artists The Sandpipers and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 Come Saturday Morning LP.</p><p>Different versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties. The original vinyl soundtrack, reissued in the early 2000s, substitutes Ami Rushes' vocals for Lynn Carey's originals, and includes one song, \"Once I Had Love\", not on the 2003 CD reissue. However, the CD edition of the soundtrack contains 25 songs compared to the 12 songs on the vinyl version. \"Incense and Peppermints\", some incidental music, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock's Hammond organ instrumental \"Toy Boy\" are missing from all soundtrack releases.</p><br/><h3>Box office</h3><p>Despite an X rating and a modest budget of $900,000, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls grossed 10 times that amount in the U.S. market, qualifying it as a hit for Fox. It has since grossed more than $40 million from theatrical revivals and video sales, according to Roger Ebert.</p><p>According to Variety, the film earned $6,800,000 in theatrical rentals in North America by 1976.</p><p>According to Fox records the film required $4,100,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $7,000,000 so made a profit to the studio.</p><br/><h3>Critical reception and legacy</h3><p>Upon release, Ebert's future TV co-host Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four, writing in the Chicago Tribune that the film \"unfolds with all of the humor and excitement of a padded bra ...
