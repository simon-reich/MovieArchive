The film was theatrically released on 11 September 2009 by Curzon Artificial Eye. Fish Tank featured on BBC's The 21st Century's 100 greatest films, ranking 65th on the list.\r\nPlot\r\nMia Williams is a volatile and socially isolated 15-year-old. She lives on an East London council estate with her single mother, Joanne, and younger sister, Tyler, and is highly antagonistic toward both of them. Mia is a loner, after falling out with her best friend, Keely. She provokes Keely's other friends, criticizes their dance routine, and head butts another girl. Mia regularly practices hip-hop dance alone in a deserted flat.\r\nNear the estate, Mia comes across a skinny, tethered horse in a Traveller encampment. She tries to free it, only to be caught, taunted, and assaulted by two young men, the horse's owners. A third young man, Billy, the brother of the other two, is more sympathetic. He shows kindness towards Mia and explains that the horse is old and ill.\r\nJoanne's new boyfriend, Conor O'Reily, is a charming and handsome Irishman. He compliments Mia on her dance moves, and invites Mia and Tyler to come with him and Joanne on a day-trip to the countryside. He introduces them to his favourite song, Bobby Womack's version of \"California Dreamin'\", and shows Mia how to catch a fish using her bare hands. Although Mia is abrupt with Conor, she appears to admire him.\r\nAt an internet caf\u00e9, Mia watches amateur breakdancing videos on YouTube. As she is leaving, she takes a leaflet for a club that is advertising for dancers. Keely's friends enter and they exchange taunts. With Billy, she sneaks into a junkyard, where Billy steals a car engine part. She visits Conor at the hardware store where he works as a security guard. Conor encourages her to apply for the dancing audition, and lends her a video camera to record an audition tape. Their interactions become increasingly flirtatious. Conor puts on cologne and asks her what she thinks of it. He then suddenly administers a spanking to her under the pretext of punishment for running off when a social worker came to visit. One night, Mia becomes jealous and angry when she overhears Conor and her mother having sex.\r\nMia sends in her tape and is invited by the club to perform in person. Late one night, with Joanne passed out drunk upstairs, and after Mia and Conor have also been drinking, Conor asks to see her dance routine in the living room. She dances to \"California Dreamin'\", and Conor then invites her to sit next to him and they have sex. Before returning to Joanne's bedroom, Conor tells Mia to keep their liaison a secret. The following morning, Mia hears her mother crying: Tyler tells her that Conor has left. Mia tracks him down to his home in Chadwell St Mary and confronts him. He explains that he cannot see her any more because of her age. He drives her to Tilbury Town railway station and provides her fare. However, Mia returns to his house and sneaks in through the house's back window. She finds a video camera which reveals footage of Conor's wife and young daughter, Keira. Out of anger, Mia urinates on the living room floor; and then sneaks out of the back door when the family return home.\r\nMia watches Keira riding her scooter outside the house, and impulsively pressures her to come with her, supposedly for ice cream, under the pretense that Keira's mother had suggested it. They walk across the fields to the River Thames, at which point Keira tries to escape. Mia catches up with her, but in the struggle inadvertently pushes her into the water. Terrified, Mia pulls her out and takes her home. As Mia returns to her home, Conor's car screeches to a halt beside her. Mia runs away and Conor chases her across a field, then strikes her across the face and walks away without a word.\r\nThe next day, Mia goes to her audition. However, she soon discovers that it is for erotic dancers. The other participants are all grown women wearing heavy makeup and provocative clothing. Mia takes the stage wearing a hoodie, but as the music starts she walks off without performing her routine.\r\nMia goes in search of Billy. When she arrives at his place, Billy tells her that the horse had to be put down, in which Mia responds by breaking down in tears. Billy says he is moving to Cardiff, and invites Mia to join him. She returns home to pack. Despite Joanne's coldness and reluctance to say goodbye, Mia, decides to join Joanne and her sister in dancing to Nas' \"Life's a Bitch\", their dance moves synchronising together. Mia goes to Billy's car after hugging Tyler goodbye. The two set off for Wales to start a new chapter in their lives.\r\nCast\r\nKatie Jarvis as Mia Williams\r\nKierston Wareing as Joanne Williams\r\nMichael Fassbender as Conor O'Reily\r\nRebecca Griffiths as Tyler Williams\r\nHarry Treadaway as Billy\r\nSydney Mary Nash as Keira O'Reily\r\nSarah Bayes as Keely\r\nProduction\r\nKatie Jarvis, who plays Mia, had no prior acting experience. She was cast for the film after one of Arnold's casting assistants saw her arguing with her boyfriend in Tilbury Town, which is the railway station featured in the film.\r\nPrincipal photography began 28 July 2008 over the course of six weeks, and was filmed in chronological order. At the end of each week the actors were given the scripts for the scenes that they would perform the following week, so that when they performed each scene they were largely unaware of what would happen to their characters later in the film.\r\nMusic\r\nMusic features prominently in the film, particularly connected with Mia's dancing. The song she uses at her audition is \"California Dreamin'\", as covered by Bobby Womack (1968).
