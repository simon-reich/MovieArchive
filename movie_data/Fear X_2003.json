But what the f**k is an ending, you know?\"\r\nIn an interview with IndieWire:\r\n\"Fear X\" is about idealists and when they're confronted with reality, a lot of the time their ideals are tested and turned and they're no longer what they thought they would be...\"\r\n\"You can view it in many different ways... it's so up to your own interpretation.\"'\r\n\"How were we going to end this, without giving anything away, without making it too obvious, because the minute the audience's mind begins to work, you're on very dangerous ground. Because if you tell them too much, they're disappointed and if you don't give them any clues, they get confused. So it's that fine line of giving the audience as they walk out, okay, I believe it's this or I believe it's that. We never gave more in the script.\"\r\nActor John Turturro also commented on the ending within an interview with Channel 4: \"I liked it because the idea of the story was about a simple man thrust into this overwhelming, debilitating circumstance, and he never really finds out what happens... Nicholas doesn't have all the answers to what he's trying to do.
