Jesse and C\u00e9line have become a couple and parents to twin girls. Jesse struggles to maintain his relationship with his teenage son, Hank, who lives in Chicago with his mother, Jesse's ex-wife. Jesse is now a successful novelist, while C\u00e9line is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government. After Hank spends the summer with Jesse and C\u00e9line on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, Jesse experiences a disconnect with Hank when he drops him off at the airport to fly home and reflects on his inability to be a good father to him.\r\nThe couple discuss their concerns about Hank, and then about C\u00e9line's career. Over dinner they talk more about love and life with friends. Two of the friends staying with them have prepaid for a hotel room for Jesse and C\u00e9line so that they can have a night alone. While walking to the hotel, the couple reminisce about their first meeting and wonder whether they would still be attracted to each other if they were strangers.\r\nAfter reaching the hotel and checking in, they begin to get intimate and prepare to have sex but are interrupted by a brief phone call from Hank, who seems to have bonded with C\u00e9line more than he has with Jesse. The couple eventually have a fierce argument, expressing fears about their present and future together. Among other issues, Jesse wants them to consider moving to Chicago so he can be closer to Hank, which C\u00e9line thinks will cost her any chance of a career outside her family. In the heat of the argument, C\u00e9line tells Jesse she no longer loves him.\r\nC\u00e9line leaves their room and sits alone in the hotel's outdoor restaurant. Jesse joins her and jokes that he is a time traveler (referencing their first meeting) bringing her a letter from her 82-year-old self, describing this night as one of the best of their lives. Unamused, C\u00e9line says their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality. Jesse proclaims his love, saying he does not know what else she could want. After a moment, C\u00e9line joins in Jesse's joke, and the two reconcile.\r\nCast\r\nEthan Hawke as Jesse\r\nJulie Delpy as C\u00e9line\r\nSeamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Hank\r\nJennifer Prior as Ella\r\nCharlotte Prior as Nina\r\nXenia Kalogeropoulou as Natalia\r\nWalter Lassally as Patrick\r\nAriane Labed as Anna\r\nYiannis Papadopoulos as Achilleas\r\nAthina Rachel Tsangari as Ariadni\r\nPanos Koronis as Stefanos\r\nProduction\r\nRichard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy had all discussed doing a sequel to Before Sunset (or the third in a trilogy). In November 2011, Hawke said that he, Delpy and Linklater\r\n\"have been talking a lot in the last six months. All three of us have been having similar feelings, that we're kind of ready to revisit those characters. There's nine years between the first two movies and, if we made the film next summer, it would be nine years again, so we started thinking that would be a good thing to do. So we're going to try and write it this year.\"\r\nIn June 2012, Hawke confirmed that the sequel to Before Sunset would be filmed that summer. Soon after, Delpy denied filming would take place that year. But by August 2012, numerous reports emerged from Messenia, Greece, that the film was being shot there.\r\nThe completion of filming the sequel, titled Before Midnight, was announced on September 5, 2012.

He intended to take it to a film festival in early 2013.\r\nRelease\r\nBefore Midnight premiered on January 20, 2013, at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 98% based on reviews from 189 critics, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's consensus is: \"Building on the first two installments in Richard Linklater's well-crafted Before trilogy, Before Midnight offers intelligent, powerfully acted perspectives on love, marriage, and long-term commitment.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 94 out of 100, based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". It was listed as the third-best film of the year after 12 Years a Slave and Gravity. It was the second-best reviewed film of 2013 according to Rotten Tomatoes, after Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Gravity.\r\nAccording to Total Film's Philip Kemp,\r\n\"As with its two predecessors \u2014 and with the films of French New Wave director \u00c9ric Rohmer, presiding deity of this kind of cinema\u2014Midnight's essentially a film about people talking.

It was directed by Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.
