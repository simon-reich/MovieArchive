Mortensen himself praised it as \"one of the best movies ever been in, if not the best\", also declaring it was a \"perfect film noir\" or \"close to perfect\".\r\nPlot\r\nTom Stall is a diner owner who lives in the small (fictional) town of Millbrook, Indiana, with a loving wife Edie, teenage son Jack, and daughter Sarah. One night, two men attempt to rob the restaurant. When a waitress is threatened, Tom deftly kills both robbers with surprising skill and precision. He is hailed as a hero by his family and the townspeople, and the incident makes him a local celebrity. Tom is visited by scarred gangster Carl Fogarty, who alleges that Tom is actually a Philadelphia gangster named Joey Cusack who had dealings with him in the Irish Mob in Philadelphia. Tom vehemently denies this, but Fogarty remains persistent and begins to stalk the Stall family. Under pressure from Fogarty and his newfound fame, Tom's relationships with his family become strained.\r\nFollowing an argument with his father over the use of violence on a bully at his school, Jack runs away. He is caught by Fogarty, who, with Jack as his hostage, goes with his men to the Stall house and demands that \"Joey\" return to Philadelphia with them. After the gangsters release Jack, Tom is slow to join them in their car, so they attempt to force him to cooperate. Tom kills the two henchmen with the same precision he used against the robbers, but Fogarty shoots Tom before he can do the same to him. As Fogarty stands over Tom, preparing to kill him, Tom finally drops the fa\u00e7ade and admits he is indeed Joey. However, before Fogarty can deliver a coup de gr\u00e2ce, Jack kills Fogarty with a shotgun.\r\nAt the hospital, Edie confronts Tom, claiming that while he was attacking Fogarty's men, she saw \"the real Joey\" that Fogarty was talking about. Tom shocks Edie by admitting that he is actually Joey Cusack, and that he has killed for both money and pleasure. He tells Edie that he ran away from Philadelphia to escape his violent criminal past. This admission deepens the tensions in their marriage.\r\nAfter Tom gets out of the hospital, Sam, the local sheriff, pays a visit. Sam expresses confusion about everything that has happened. He tells Tom and Edie that these mobsters wouldn't go to all this trouble if they weren't sure they had the right man. Just when Tom is about to confess, Edie lies to Sam, claiming that Tom is who he says he is, and that their family has suffered enough. At a loss for words after Edie breaks down into tears, Sam leaves. Edie and Tom then start slapping and hitting each other, their fight eventually culminating in violent sex on the stairs. Afterward, Edie and Jack continue to further distance themselves from Tom, leaving him isolated. He receives a call from his brother Richie Cusack, who also demands his return to Philadelphia, or else he will come to Indiana to find him. After traveling to meet his brother, Tom learns that the other mobsters whom he had offended in Philadelphia took out their frustrations on Richie, penalizing him financially and delaying his advancement in the organization. Tom offers to make peace, but Richie orders his men to kill his brother. Tom manages to kill most of the guards and escape. As Richie and his last henchman are hunting for him, Tom surprises and kills both of them.\r\nTom returns home, where the atmosphere is tense and silent as the family sits around the dinner table.\r\nCast\r\nViggo Mortensen as Thomas \"Tom\" Stall / Joseph \"Joey\" Cusack\r\nMaria Bello as Edie Stall\r\nEd Harris as Carl Fogarty\r\nWilliam Hurt as Richie Cusack\r\nAshton Holmes as Jack Stall\r\nPeter MacNeill as Sheriff Sam Carney\r\nStephen McHattie as Leland Jones\r\nGreg Bryk as Billy Orser\r\nKyle Schmid as Bobby\r\nSumela Kay as Judy Danvers\r\nGerry Quigley as Mick\r\nDeborah Drakeford as Charlotte\r\nHeidi Hayes as Sarah Stall\r\nAidan Devine as Charles \"Charlie\" Roarke\r\nBill McDonald as Frank Mulligan\r\nMichelle McCree as Jenny Wyeth\r\nIan Matthews as Ruben\r\nR. D. Reid as Pat\r\nMorgan Kelly as Bobby's Buddy\r\nProduction\r\nMost of the film was shot in Millbrook, Ontario. The shopping centre scene was shot in Tottenham, Ontario, and the climactic scene was shot at the historic Eaton Hall Mansion, located in King City, Ontario.\r\nAlternate versions\r\nThe U.S. and European versions differ on only two fight scenes: one where Tom breaks the nose of one of Fogarty's thugs and one where he stomps on the throat of one of Richie Cusack's thugs. Both scenes display more blood flowing or gushing out of the victims in the European version. In addition, a more pronounced bone-crushing sound effect is used when Tom stomps on the thug's throat.\r\nA deleted scene, known as \"Scene 44\", features a dream sequence in the diner, where Fogarty tells Tom he will kill him and his family; to which Tom responds by shooting him with his shotgun at close range. He then approaches Fogarty's mangled body, which raises a gun and shoots him. In the DVD extras' on-set footage, Mortensen suggests Harris should pull the gun from his chest cavity. Cronenberg, while amused by the idea, rejects it for being too self-referential; he cites a sequence in his film Videodrome, in which a character pulls a handgun from a slit in his stomach.\r\nInterpretation\r\nThe film's title plays on multiple levels of meaning. Film critic Roger Ebert stated that Cronenberg refers to 3 possibilities:\r\n...

            "html": "<h2>A History of Violence</h2><p>A History of Violence is a 2005 American action thriller film directed by David Cronenberg and written by Josh Olson. It is an adaptation of the 1997 graphic novel of the same title by John Wagner and Vince Locke. The film stars Viggo Mortensen as the owner of a small-town diner who is thrust into the spotlight after confronting two robbers in self-defense, thus changing his life forever.</p><p>The film was in the main competition for the 2005 Palme d'Or. The film was put into limited release in the United States on September 23, 2005, and wide release on September 30, 2005.</p><p>William Hurt was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, while Olson was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. The Los Angeles Times has called it the last major Hollywood film to be released on VHS. Mortensen himself praised it as \"one of the best movies ever been in, if not the best\", also declaring it was a \"perfect film noir\" or \"close to perfect\".</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Tom Stall is a diner owner who lives in the small (fictional) town of Millbrook, Indiana, with a loving wife Edie, teenage son Jack, and daughter Sarah. One night, two men attempt to rob the restaurant. When a waitress is threatened, Tom deftly kills both robbers with surprising skill and precision. He is hailed as a hero by his family and the townspeople, and the incident makes him a local celebrity. Tom is visited by scarred gangster Carl Fogarty, who alleges that Tom is actually a Philadelphia gangster named Joey Cusack who had dealings with him in the Irish Mob in Philadelphia. Tom vehemently denies this, but Fogarty remains persistent and begins to stalk the Stall family. Under pressure from Fogarty and his newfound fame, Tom's relationships with his family become strained.</p><p>Following an argument with his father over the use of violence on a bully at his school, Jack runs away. He is caught by Fogarty, who, with Jack as his hostage, goes with his men to the Stall house and demands that \"Joey\" return to Philadelphia with them. After the gangsters release Jack, Tom is slow to join them in their car, so they attempt to force him to cooperate. Tom kills the two henchmen with the same precision he used against the robbers, but Fogarty shoots Tom before he can do the same to him. As Fogarty stands over Tom, preparing to kill him, Tom finally drops the fa\u00e7ade and admits he is indeed Joey. However, before Fogarty can deliver a coup de gr\u00e2ce, Jack kills Fogarty with a shotgun.</p><p>At the hospital, Edie confronts Tom, claiming that while he was attacking Fogarty's men, she saw \"the real Joey\" that Fogarty was talking about. Tom shocks Edie by admitting that he is actually Joey Cusack, and that he has killed for both money and pleasure. He tells Edie that he ran away from Philadelphia to escape his violent criminal past. This admission deepens the tensions in their marriage.</p><p>After Tom gets out of the hospital, Sam, the local sheriff, pays a visit. Sam expresses confusion about everything that has happened. He tells Tom and Edie that these mobsters wouldn't go to all this trouble if they weren't sure they had the right man. Just when Tom is about to confess, Edie lies to Sam, claiming that Tom is who he says he is, and that their family has suffered enough. At a loss for words after Edie breaks down into tears, Sam leaves. Edie and Tom then start slapping and hitting each other, their fight eventually culminating in violent sex on the stairs. Afterward, Edie and Jack continue to further distance themselves from Tom, leaving him isolated. He receives a call from his brother Richie Cusack, who also demands his return to Philadelphia, or else he will come to Indiana to find him. After traveling to meet his brother, Tom learns that the other mobsters whom he had offended in Philadelphia took out their frustrations on Richie, penalizing him financially and delaying his advancement in the organization. Tom offers to make peace, but Richie orders his men to kill his brother. Tom manages to kill most of the guards and escape. As Richie and his last henchman are hunting for him, Tom surprises and kills both of them.</p><p>Tom returns home, where the atmosphere is tense and silent as the family sits around the dinner table.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Viggo Mortensen as Thomas \"Tom\" Stall / Joseph \"Joey\" Cusack</li><li>Maria Bello as Edie Stall</li><li>Ed Harris as Carl Fogarty</li><li>William Hurt as Richie Cusack</li><li>Ashton Holmes as Jack Stall</li><li>Peter MacNeill as Sheriff Sam Carney</li><li>Stephen McHattie as Leland Jones</li><li>Greg Bryk as Billy Orser</li><li>Kyle Schmid as Bobby</li><li>Sumela Kay as Judy Danvers</li><li>Gerry Quigley as Mick</li><li>Deborah Drakeford as Charlotte</li><li>Heidi Hayes as Sarah Stall</li><li>Aidan Devine as Charles \"Charlie\" Roarke</li><li>Bill McDonald as Frank Mulligan</li><li>Michelle McCree as Jenny Wyeth</li><li>Ian Matthews as Ruben</li><li>R. D. Reid as Pat</li><li>Morgan Kelly as Bobby's Buddy</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>Most of the film was shot in Millbrook, Ontario. The shopping centre scene was shot in Tottenham, Ontario, and the climactic scene was shot at the historic Eaton Hall Mansion, located in King City, Ontario.</p><h4>Alternate versions</h4><p>The U.S. and European versions differ on only two fight scenes: one where Tom breaks the nose of one of Fogarty's thugs and one where he stomps on the throat of one of Richie Cusack's thugs. Both scenes display more blood flowing or gushing out of the victims in the European version. In addition, a more pronounced bone-crushing sound effect is used when Tom stomps on the thug's throat.</p><p>A deleted scene, known as \"Scene 44\", features a dream sequence in the diner, where Fogarty tells Tom he will kill him and his family; to which Tom responds by shooting him with his shotgun at close range. He then approaches Fogarty's mangled body, which raises a gun and shoots him. In the DVD extras' on-set footage, Mortensen suggests Harris should pull the gun from his chest cavity. Cronenberg, while amused by the idea, rejects it for being too self-referential; he cites a sequence in his film Videodrome, in which a character pulls a handgun from a slit in his stomach.</p><br/><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>The film's title plays on multiple levels of meaning. Film critic Roger Ebert stated that Cronenberg refers to 3 possibilities:</p><blockquote>... (1) a suspect with a long history of violence; (2) the historical use of violence as a means of settling disputes, and (3) the innate violence of Darwinian evolution, in which better-adapted organisms replace those less able to cope. \"I am a complete Darwinian\", says Cronenberg, whose new film is in many ways about the survival of the fittest\u2014at all costs.</blockquote><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>A History of Violence premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2005, and was released in the United States on September 30 following a successful limited release on September 23, 2005.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>The film was released on DVD and VHS formats on March 14, 2006, and was reported by The Los Angeles Times as being the very last major Hollywood film to be released on VHS.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>The film started with a limited release in 14 theaters and grossed $515,992 at the box office, averaging $36,856 per theater. A week later, it went on a wide release in 1,340 theaters and grossed $8,103,077 in its opening weekend.
