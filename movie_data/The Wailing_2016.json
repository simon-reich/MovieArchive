His partner relays gossip that a Japanese stranger, who lives in a secluded house in the mountains, would be an evil spirit responsible for the illness. Jong-Goo decides to visit the stranger along with his partner and a young priest who speaks Japanese. They find an altar with a goat head, pictures on the walls of the infected people that died, and an attacking guard dog that prevents their departure until the stranger arrives. Jong-Goo finds one shoe of his beloved daughter, Hyo-jin, in the house of the stranger, and soon she becomes sick. His mother-in-law summons the shaman Il-gwang to save her granddaughter while a mysterious woman tells Jong-Goo that the stranger is responsible. Who might be the demon that is bringing sickness to Goksung?",

The film centers on a policeman who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illnesses in a remote Korean hamlet called Gokseong in order to save his daughter. The film was both a commercial and critical success.\r\nPlot\r\nA Japanese man, called by everyone as a stranger, arrives at Gokseong, a small rural village in the mountains of South Korea, and lives in a secluded house in the forest. The village is soon hit by a violent murderous outbreak where the infected got a rash and then killed their family members in a hysterical tantrum. The incident leaves the police officer, Jong-goo bewildered.\r\nJong-goo tells his partner, Oh Seong-bok, a rumor about the Japanese stranger while they leisurely sit at their office. He then meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (\u201cno name\u201d in Korean) at the crime scene, who tells him that the stranger is a ghost and the culprit. Jong-goo tries to hold her as a witness but as he calls Oh Seong-bok, she goes missing. A local hunter tells Jong-goo and Oh Seong-bok that he saw the stranger with glowing red eyes, eating a raw deer in the forest.\r\nJong-goo is unsettled, as he has had dreams about this stranger, and tries to investigate him with Oh Seong-bok. They enlist the help of Oh Seong-bok's nephew, a Japanese-speaking deacon named Yang I-sam as an interpreter. They arrive at the stranger's house and don't find him there, which gives them the opportunity to investigate the empty house. Oh Seong-bok finds pictures of the murdered village residents and their belongings in a small room while Jong-goo finds a worship room. The stranger's guard dog, which was tied to a chain outside, gets loose and attacks them only to stop when the stranger arrives. Jong-goo and his team leave.\r\nWhile on the road going back home, Oh Seong-bok tells him of what he saw, and hands over a shoe that belongs to Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin. Soon Hyo-jin becomes sick and displays similar symptoms as the other infected villagers. Jong-goo returns to the stranger's house, but finds that all the evidence has been burned. Infuriated, he starts smashing up the stranger's worship room and kills the dog when it attacks him, ordering the stranger to leave the village.\r\nDistraught about Hyo-jin's condition, Jong-goo's mother-in-law seeks help from a shaman, Il-gwang. Il-gwang performs a ritual to exorcise the demon with condition that Jong-goo will not interrupt the ritual. At the same time, the stranger performs a ritual in his house, only to be interrupts as he feel excruciating pain. Jong-goo finds his daughter screaming in pain as Il-gwang performs his exorcism and forcefully stops the ritual, taking her to a hospital instead.\r\nThe following day, he gathers his friends to hunt down the stranger, believing that the stranger is responsible for the disease and murders. The group gets attacked by one of the infected villagers, injuring Yang I-sam while the stranger runs away. They try to chase the stranger but lose sight of him at a cliff. The stranger sees Moo-myeong at the bottom of the cliff and tries to chase her. They eventually end up hitting the stranger with their vehicle in the middle of the road. They dispose of his body as Moo-myeong watches from the hills. When Jong-goo returns home, he finds that Hyo-jin's condition has seemingly improved.\r\nIn the aftermath, Il-gwang tries to convince people that they killed the wrong person only to encounters Moo-myeong in front of Jong-goo's house, and starts vomiting blood. Scared by the incident, Il-gwang tries to flee the city but eventually decides to turn back. On his way back, he tells Jong-goo via phone that Moo-myeong is the real demon and the stranger was just a shaman like him. Meanwhile, the wounded Yang I-sam receives news that his uncle, Oh Seong-bok went berserk and killed his entire family.\r\nJong-goo returns home only to find Hyo-jin missing. While searching for her, he meets Moo-myeong. She explains that she has set a trap for the demon, but the trap will not work if Jong-goo returns home as Hyo-jin will kill everyone. Il-gwang calls Jong-goo again and tells him not to believe her and he should come back home to guard his family. Moo-myeong in turn tells him that Il-gwang is actually a mere pawn of the real demon. Confused and hesitant, Jong-goo asks Moo-myeong if she is a human or a ghost to which she gives a cryptic answer. Moo-myeong grabs Jong-goo in an effort to convince him not to leave. Jong-goo instead notices that she is wearing the personal items of the victims including her daughter's hair pin. Jong-goo concludes that she is the culprit and pulls himself away. The moment he crosses his home's threshold, the floral trap set by Moo-myeong withers.\r\nYang I-sam returns back to the stranger's house with a sickle and a cross in his hand. He finds a secret cave near the house and encounters the still-alive stranger inside. Yang I-sam asks the stranger about his identity only for the stranger to ask him in return what he thinks he is. Yang I-sam replies that he thinks the stranger is a demon but if he turns out wrong, he will leave him peacefully. The stranger laughs at the answer and say that he the one that would not let him leave instead. He then proceeds to photograph Yang I-sam as he witnesses the stranger change into his true form, a demon.\r\nBack home, Jong-goo finds that Hyo-jin has murdered their family in a hysterical tantrum. He weeps and calls out to Hyo-jin but she is in a stupor and doesn't respond. Il-gwang arrives and takes photographs of Jong-goo's dead family. While returning to his car, he unintentionally drops a box filled with photos of the murdered villagers that the stranger claimed to have burned. As Jong-goo sits traumatized in his home, he hallucinates of happier times with his daughter and begins to smile, assuring her that he will protect her.\r\nCast\r\nKwak Do-won as Jong-goo, police man and father of Hyo-Jin.\r\nHwang Jung-min as Il-gwang, a shaman hired to protect the village.\r\nChun Woo-hee as Moo-myung, the woman in white.\r\nJun Kunimura as Japanese stranger.\r\nKim Hwan-hee as Hyo-jin, Jong-goo's daughter.\r\nHer Jin as Jong-goo Mother-in-law\r\nJang So-yeon as Jon-goo Wife\r\nKim Do-yoon as Yang I-sam, Japanese speaking deacon\r\nSon Gang-guk as Oh Seong-bok, Jong-goo police partner\r\nPark Seong-yeon as Kwon Myeong-joo\r\nKil Chang-gyoo as Park Choon-bae\r\nJeon Bae-soo as Deok-gi\r\nJeong Mi-nam as Heung-gook\r\nChoi Gwi-hwa as Byeong-gyoo\r\nBaek Seung-cheol as Friend\r\nKwon Hyeok-joon as Friend\r\nPark Chae-ik as Friend\r\nKim Gi-cheon as Dispatch captain\r\nYoo Soon-woong as Chief of police\r\nJo Han-cheol as Detective 1\r\nKim Song-il as Police\r\nBae Yong-geun as Police\r\nIm Jae-il as Police\r\nLee In-cheol as Father\r\nJo Seon-joo as Bar hostess\r\nLee Chang-hoon as Doctor\r\nKim Ji-won as Nurse\r\nRelease\r\nThe Wailing was released in South Korea on May 12, 2016.

Jason Bechervaise of Screen Daily noted \"The Wailing is initially set up as a thriller and the supernatural setting also helps deliver moments akin to a horror feature, particularly when a strange woman (Chun Woo-hee) first appears.

Jacob Hall of /Film commented \"The Wailing as it exists would involve burning the very structure of a traditional western movie to the ground.

The film centers on a policeman who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illnesses in a remote Korean hamlet called Gokseong in order to save his daughter. The film was both a commercial and critical success.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>A Japanese man, called by everyone as a stranger, arrives at Gokseong, a small rural village in the mountains of South Korea, and lives in a secluded house in the forest. The village is soon hit by a violent murderous outbreak where the infected got a rash and then killed their family members in a hysterical tantrum. The incident leaves the police officer, Jong-goo bewildered.</p><p>Jong-goo tells his partner, Oh Seong-bok, a rumor about the Japanese stranger while they leisurely sit at their office. He then meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (\u201cno name\u201d in Korean) at the crime scene, who tells him that the stranger is a ghost and the culprit. Jong-goo tries to hold her as a witness but as he calls Oh Seong-bok, she goes missing. A local hunter tells Jong-goo and Oh Seong-bok that he saw the stranger with glowing red eyes, eating a raw deer in the forest.</p><p>Jong-goo is unsettled, as he has had dreams about this stranger, and tries to investigate him with Oh Seong-bok.
