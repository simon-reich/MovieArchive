    "plot": "Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal), a successful private equity fund partner, struggles after losing his wife in a tragic car crash. Despite pressure from his father-in-law, Phil (Chris Cooper), to pull it together, Davis continues to unravel. What starts as a complaint letter to a vending machine company turns into a series of letters revealing startling personal admissions. Davis' letters catch the attention of customer service rep, Karen (Naomi Watts), and, amidst emotional and financial burdens of her own, the two form an unlikely connection. With the help of Karen and her son Chris (Judah Lewis), Davis starts to rebuild, beginning with the demolition of the life he once knew.",

The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomi Watts, Chris Cooper, and Judah Lewis. The film opened the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival and was theatrically released on April 8, 2016, by Fox Searchlight Pictures.\r\nPlot\r\nDavis is a successful investment banker at a firm founded and run by his father-in-law Phil. His wife, Julia, is driving them when they are struck by another vehicle, killing Julia. Recovering in the hospital, he attempts to purchase some candy from a vending machine which malfunctions. Davis drafts a complaint to the vending machine manufacturer that includes some venting of his personal experiences. This leads to a series of conversations with a customer service representative, Karen Moreno, in which they end up sharing details of each other's life burdens. Karen appears to be the only one he talks to, though tells his stories in an understated and unemotional style. He brings this same unemotional process to work, which he has returned to much earlier than anyone expected. Davis does tell one other person, a fellow commuter train rider that he realizes that he didn't love Julia because he doesn't feel \"...sad, or pain, or hurt...\".\r\nDavis's changing emotional state causes him to behave erratically. He notices that he is being followed by a green station wagon. The only thing Davis seems to connect with is trying to understand what's inside things, using a small toolkit to dismantle his household appliances, his work computer, a bathroom stall\u2014eventually telling Phil that he has an urge to dismantle a 120-year-old grandmother clock in Phil's office.\r\nKaren follows Davis, talking with him on his commuter train without revealing her identity. She mistakenly leaves some identification, and Davis is sufficiently moved to track her down at home, where she lives with her boyfriend and boss, Carl, and her 15-year old troublemaker son, Chris. When Carl goes on a long business trip, Davis bunks at her house, where they develop a deep platonic friendship. Chris initially dislikes Davis, but later grows not only to like him but to help Davis cope, while Davis becomes his mentor in return.\r\nDavis joins his in-laws in funding a foundation in Julia's name that will award an annual scholarship; during interviews, Davis behaves disrespectfully towards one of the award candidates, and Phil asks him to sign a transfer of his beneficiary rights in Julia's $2.6 million life insurance policy, to the scholarship fund in her name. Davis purchases demolition tools from a hardware store (and, later, a bulldozer) and, with Chris's assistance, destroys his house. When Davis finds an ultrasound of Julia's from the previous year, he is devastated that she failed to inform him.\r\nA climactic night impacts everyone. Davis brings Karen to the party for the scholarship winner, greatly troubling Julia's parents. A young man makes an inappropriate advance on Karen, and she later laughs out loud when he is introduced as the scholarship winner. Davis announces to everyone that Julia had been pregnant and kept it secret. Julia's mother tells him his wife was seeing someone else, and the child was not his and she took her to get an abortion. Returning to Karen's house, Davis finds Carl has returned and is reading the letters Davis wrote to Karen. Carl beats on Davis, which pales compared to the homophobic swarm beating that Chris receives after coming out as gay.\r\nDavis visits his wife's grave and the green station wagon arrives and a man carrying flowers gets out of the car. He is Michael, the driver of the car that killed Julia. Davis forgives Michael and he experiences flashbacks of his wife and him together and he finally cries, bringing closure. He realizes he loved his wife.\r\nDavis has turned a corner. He reconciles with Julia's parents, asking Phil to contribute to refurbishing a carousel \u2013 destined for demolition \u2013 as a memorial for Julia.\r\nDavis receives a letter from Chris saying that he is recovering from his beating, his mother has left Carl, and Davis must be at Pier 54 at a particular time, which results in Davis witnessing the demolition of some waterfront buildings across the Hudson River. Chris watches Davis through binoculars from a nearby vantage point.\r\nCast\r\nJake Gyllenhaal as Davis Mitchell, an investment banker\r\nNaomi Watts as Karen Moreno, a customer service representative and the interest of a grieving Davis\r\nChris Cooper as Phil Eastwood, Davis's father in-law\r\nJudah Lewis as Chris Moreno, Karen's son\r\nC.J. Wilson as Carl\r\nPolly Draper as Margot Eastwood\r\nMalachy Cleary as Davis's father\r\nDebra Monk as Davis's mother\r\nHeather Lind as Julia, Davis's wife\r\nAlfredo Narciso as Michael (owner of green car)\r\nProduction\r\nIn May 2013, director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e was set to direct Demolition, for a 2015 release date. On October 9, 2013, it was announced that Black Label Media would finance the film, and would co-produce along with Mr. Mudd. On June 6, 2014, Jake Gyllenhaal was in early talks to star in the film. On July 21, Naomi Watts was in talks to join the film. On September 4, Watts was confirmed cast in the film to play the female lead. On September 10, Chris Cooper was set to star in the film. On October 18, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Fox Searchlight Pictures had acquired the US rights to the film, and director Vall\u00e9e said, \"I'm thrilled and excited to be back in business with Fox Searchlight. They have been wonderful, creative partners on Wild. I look forward to collaborating again on Demolition.\" Judah Lewis' role as the son of Watts' character Karen Moreno was confirmed on July 15, 2015.\r\nFilming\r\nFilming began on September 15, 2014, in New York City. On October 8, filming was taking place on Greenwich Street in NYC.\r\nRelease\r\nOn July 15, 2015, Fox Searchlight Pictures set the film for a wide release on April 8, 2016.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nIn the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking suggested the film would gross $2\u20133 million from 854 theaters in its opening weekend, trailing fellow newcomers The Boss ($20\u201324 million projection) and Hardcore Henry ($7\u201310 million projection). It ended up grossing just $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 15th at the box office.\r\nCritical response\r\nDemolition received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 53% approval rating based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 5.81/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Demolition benefits from a stellar cast, even if their solid work isn't always enough to prop up a confused story that aims for profundity but too often settles for clich\u00e9s.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 49 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",

Davis brings Karen to the party for the scholarship winner, greatly troubling Julia's parents. A young man makes an inappropriate advance on Karen, and she later laughs out loud when he is introduced as the scholarship winner. Davis announces to everyone that Julia had been pregnant and kept it secret. Julia's mother tells him his wife was seeing someone else, and the child was not his and she took her to get an abortion. Returning to Karen's house, Davis finds Carl has returned and is reading the letters Davis wrote to Karen. Carl beats on Davis, which pales compared to the homophobic swarm beating that Chris receives after coming out as gay.</p><p>Davis visits his wife's grave and the green station wagon arrives and a man carrying flowers gets out of the car. He is Michael, the driver of the car that killed Julia. Davis forgives Michael and he experiences flashbacks of his wife and him together and he finally cries, bringing closure. He realizes he loved his wife.</p><p>Davis has turned a corner. He reconciles with Julia's parents, asking Phil to contribute to refurbishing a carousel \u2013 destined for demolition \u2013 as a memorial for Julia.</p><p>Davis receives a letter from Chris saying that he is recovering from his beating, his mother has left Carl, and Davis must be at Pier 54 at a particular time, which results in Davis witnessing the demolition of some waterfront buildings across the Hudson River. Chris watches Davis through binoculars from a nearby vantage point.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Jake Gyllenhaal as Davis Mitchell, an investment banker</li><li>Naomi Watts as Karen Moreno, a customer service representative and the interest of a grieving Davis</li><li>Chris Cooper as Phil Eastwood, Davis's father in-law</li><li>Judah Lewis as Chris Moreno, Karen's son</li><li>C.J.
