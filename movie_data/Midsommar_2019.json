    "plot": "Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) are a young American couple with a relationship on the brink of falling apart. But after a family tragedy keeps them together, a grieving Dani invites herself to join Christian and his friends on a trip to a once-in-a-lifetime midsummer festival in a remote Swedish village. What begins as a carefree summer holiday in a land of eternal sunlight takes a sinister turn when the insular villagers invite their guests to partake in festivities that render the pastoral paradise increasingly unnerving and viscerally disturbing.",

            "plainText": "Midsommar (film)\r\nMidsommar is a 2019 folk horror film written and directed by Ari Aster and starring Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, William Jackson Harper, Vilhelm Blomgren, Ellora Torchia, Archie Madekwe, and Will Poulter. It follows a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a festival that occurs once every 90 years, only to find themselves in the clutches of a pagan cult.\r\nA co-production between the United States and Sweden, the film was initially pitched to Aster as a straightforward slasher film set amongst Swedish cultists. Aster devised a screenplay using elements of the concept, but made a deteriorating relationship the central conflict after he experienced a difficult breakup.

It follows a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a festival that occurs once every 90 years, only to find themselves in the clutches of a pagan cult.\r\nA co-production between the United States and Sweden, the film was initially pitched to Aster as a straightforward slasher film set amongst Swedish cultists. Aster devised a screenplay using elements of the concept, but made a deteriorating relationship the central conflict after he experienced a difficult breakup. The film was shot on location in Budapest in the summer and autumn of 2018.\r\nMidsommar was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 2019, by A24 and in Sweden on July 10, 2019, by Nordisk Film. The film grossed $47 million and received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Aster's direction and Pugh's performance.\r\nPlot\r\nPsychology student Dani Ardor is traumatized after her sister Terri kills herself and their parents by filling their home with carbon monoxide. The incident strains Dani's relationship with her emotionally distant boyfriend, cultural anthropology student Christian Hughes. She later learns that Christian and his friends Mark and Josh have been invited by their mutual Swedish friend Pelle to attend a midsummer celebration at Pelle's ancestral commune, the H\u00e5rga, in H\u00e4lsingland. The celebration occurs only once every 90 years and Josh, also an anthropology student, wants to write his thesis on it. Christian had hidden the trip from Dani, wanting to break up with her before leaving, but invites her along after she finds out about it.\r\nThe group flies to Sweden and arrives at the commune, where they meet Simon and Connie, an English couple from London who were invited by Pelle's communal brother Ingemar. He offers the group psychedelic mushrooms, and Dani has hallucinations of Terri while under the drug's influence. Tensions rise after the group witnesses an \u00e4ttestupa, a tradition which sees two commune elders attempt to kill themselves by leaping from a cliff onto a rock. When one of the elders survives the fall, the commune members mimic his wails of agony and crush his skull with a mallet, while commune elder Siv attempts to calm Dani and her friends by explaining that this is a normal thing every member does when they reach the age of 72. The scene disturbs the group but they decide to stay long enough for Josh to finish his thesis, while Simon and Connie decide to leave.\r\nChristian also decides to write his thesis on the H\u00e5rga, creating a rift between him and Josh, who accuses him of copying his idea. Meanwhile, Dani's already weak mental state deteriorates, exacerbated by her decision to leave her supply of the anti-anxiety medication Ativan at home. She asks Josh for a sleeping pill and later dreams that she awakes to a sound and walks outside to see that the people she came with are driving away in the car they arrived in. She tries to cry out but dark smoke escapes her mouth. The next scene in her dream is of the deceased elder man and then of her parents and sister lying around the rock that the elders fell onto. Later, Maja walks to Christian's bed while everyone is still asleep and places something under it as Josh watches. Josh takes it and asks Pelle what it is and Pelle tells him that it is a rune for a love spell. He then tells Josh that the commune will allow him to write his thesis about their festival as long as he signs and agreement and shares it with Christian. Then, he sees Christian approach and tells him the same and that he thinks that Maja has an interest in him and tells him that last year she became byxmyndig, or of the age for consent. After Mark unwittingly urinates on an ancestral tree and incites the fury of the commune, he is lured away during dinner by a female member who feigns interest in him. An elder tells Connie that Simon has already left without her. Confused and suspicious, Connie decides to leave on her own; later, a woman's wail is heard in the distance. That night, Josh sneaks into the temple to take a photograph of the commune's sacred runic text, which an elder had previously forbidden him from doing. He sees a half naked man wearing Mark's skinned face and is hit over the head, after which his body is dragged away.\r\nThe next day, Dani is given tea that contains more psychedelic drugs and ends up winning a maypole dancing competition, subsequently being crowned May Queen. At the same time, Christian is given more drugs before being coerced into a sex ritual designed to impregnate one of the female members, Maja, while older naked female members watch. After discovering Christian and Maja having sex, Dani has a panic attack, during which the commune's younger women surround her and mimic her cries. After the ritual, Christian comes to his senses and tries to run away, but he instead discovers Josh's leg planted in a flowerbed and Simon's body (which has been turned into a blood eagle) in a barn. Christian is then paralyzed by an elder.\r\nThe commune leaders explain to Dani that, to purge the commune of its evil, eight human sacrifices must be offered. The first four victims are outsiders (Mark, Josh, Simon, and Connie) lured to them by Pelle and Ingemar, while the next four victims must be commune members. As May Queen, Dani must choose either Christian or a local villager to be the ninth and final victim. She chooses to sacrifice Christian, who is stuffed into a disemboweled brown bear's body and placed in a small wooden temple alongside the other live sacrifices and corpses. The temple is set on fire and the commune members celebrate by mimicking the screams and wails of those being burned alive. Dani initially sobs in horror, but gradually begins to smile.\r\nCast\r\nFlorence Pugh as Dani Ardor\r\nJack Reynor as Christian Hughes\r\nWilliam Jackson Harper as Josh\r\nVilhelm Blomgren as Pelle\r\nWill Poulter as Mark\r\nEllora Torchia as Connie\r\nArchie Madekwe as Simon\r\nHenrik Norl\u00e9n as Ulf\r\nGunnel Fred as Siv\r\nIsabelle Grill as Maja\r\nAgnes Rase as Dagny\r\nJulia Ragnarsson as Inga\r\nMats Blomgren as Odd\r\nLars V\u00e4ringer as Sten\r\nAnna \u00c5str\u00f6m as Karin\r\nHampus Hallberg as Ingemar\r\nLiv Mj\u00f6nes as Ulla\r\nLouise Peterhoff as Hanna\r\nKatarina Weidhagen as Ylva\r\nBj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen as Dan\r\nTomas Engstr\u00f6m as Jarl\r\nDag Andersson as Sven\r\nLennart R.

B-Reel Films, a Swedish company, produced the film alongside Square Peg, with A24 distributing. According to Aster, he had been approached by B-Reel executives to helm a slasher film set in Sweden, an idea which he initially rejected as he felt he \"had no way into the story.\" Aster ultimately devised a plot in which the two central characters are experiencing relationship tensions verging on a breakup, and wrote the surrounding screenplay around this theme. He described the result as \"a breakup movie dressed in the clothes of a folk horror film.\"\r\nIn July 2018, Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, Vilhem Blomgren, William Jackson Harper, Ellora Torchia, and Archie Madekwe joined the cast. Principal photography began on July 30, 2018, in Budapest, Hungary, and wrapped in October 2018.\r\nRelease\r\nMidsommar had a pre-release screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in New York City, on June 18, 2019. The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 2019. It was released in Sweden on July 10, 2019.\r\nDirector's cut\r\nAster's original 171-minute cut of the film, which A24 asked Aster to trim down for a wide theatrical release, had its world premiere at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City on August 20, 2019. It was released in theaters nationwide on August 29, 2019 for one weekend only. The director's cut became an Apple TV exclusive on September 24, 2019. The United Kingdom released the cut on Blu-ray and DVD on October 28, 2019. In July 2020, the director's cut became available in the United States on Blu-ray.\r\nHome media\r\nMidsommar was released on Digital HD on September 24, 2019, and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 8, 2019.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nMidsommar grossed $27.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $20.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $47.9 million.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $8\u201310 million from 2,707 theaters over its first five days. It made $3 million on its first day, including $1.1 million from Tuesday night previews, which Deadline Hollywood called a \"smashing start.\" It went on to debut to $10.9 million, finishing sixth at the box office; IndieWire said it was \"just decent\" given its estimated $8 million budget, but the film would likely find success in home media. In its second weekend, the film dropped 44% to $3.7 million, finishing in eighth, and then made $1.6 million in its third weekend, finishing in ninth.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 385 reviews, with an average rating of 7.56/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Ambitious, impressively crafted, and above all unsettling, Midsommar further proves writer-director Ari Aster is a horror auteur to be reckoned with.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 3 out of 5 stars, with 50% saying they would definitely recommend it.\r\nJohn DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as the \"horror equivalent of a destination wedding\", and \"more unsettling than frightening, still a trip worth taking.\" Writing for Variety, Andrew Barker noted that it is \"neither the masterpiece nor the disaster that the film's most vocal viewers are bound to claim. Rather, it's an admirably strange, thematically muddled curiosity from a talented filmmaker who allows his ambitions to outpace his execution.\" David Edelstein of Vulture praised Pugh's performance as \"amazingly vivid\" and noted that Aster \"paces Midsommar more like an opera (Wagner, not Puccini) than a scare picture,\" but concluded that the film \"doesn't jell because its impulses are so bifurcated. It's a parable of a woman's religious awakening\u2014that's also a woman's fantasy of revenge against a man who didn't meet her emotional needs\u2014that's also a male director's masochistic fantasy of emasculation at the hands of a matriarchal cult.\"\r\nEric Kohn of IndieWire summarized the film as a \"perverse breakup movie,\" adding that \"Aster doesn't always sink the biggest surprises, but he excels at twisting the knife. After a deflowering that makes Ken Russell's The Devils look tame, Aster finds his way to a startling reality check.\" Time Out's Joshua Rothkopf awarded the film a 5/5 star-rating, writing, \"A savage yet evolved slice of Swedish folk-horror, Ari Aster's hallucinatory follow-up to Hereditary proves him a horror director with no peer.\"\r\nFor The A.V. Club, A. A. Dowd stated that the film \"rivals Hereditary in the cruel shock department\", and labeled it a \"B+ effort\". Writing for Inverse, Eric Francisco commented that the film feels \"like a victory lap after Hereditary\", and that Aster \"takes his sweet time to lull viewers into his clutches ... But like how the characters experience time, its passage is a vague notion.\" He described the film as \"a sharp portrayal of gaslighting\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker said that the film \"is built on such a void of insight and experience, such a void of character and relationships, that even the first level of the house of narrative cards can't stand.\" He added, \"In the end, the subject of Midsommar is as simple as it is regressive: lucky Americans, stay home.\"\r\nNicolas Cage said that the film \"was exciting\" and said it had \"Bergmanesque shots\". Jordan Peele said the film had \"the most atrociously disturbing imagery I've ever seen on film\" and \"usurps The Wicker Man as the most iconic pagan movie to be referenced\".\r\nAccolades",
