            "plainText": "Goodnight Mommy\r\nGoodnight Mommy (German: Ich seh, Ich seh, lit. 'I see, I see'; UK: Goodnight Mummy) is a 2014 Austrian horror film. The film is written and directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala. It was selected as the Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.\r\nPlot\r\nAfter undergoing cosmetic facial surgery, a woman (Susanne Wuest) comes back home to her modern, isolated lakeside house and to her nine-year-old twin sons, Elias and Lukas (Elias and Lukas Schwarz). Her head is swathed in bandages, with only her eyes and mouth visible. The twins are unnerved by their mother's appearance and are further taken aback when she begins to exhibit strange behavior. She pointedly ignores Lukas and appears to only acknowledge Elias in conversation. Though it is the middle of summer, the mother orders the twins to keep the blinds closed during the day, imposes a strict rule of silence inside the house, and allows them to only play outdoors. The mother also acts cruelly and lashes out at Elias physically when he is mischievous or disobedient. The boys comment that this is something their mother would never do.\r\nThe Twins begin to suspect that beneath her bandages, their mother may not be the same person. These doubts are confirmed when they find an old picture that shows the mother with another unknown woman who is wearing identical clothes and shares similar physical traits. With the suspicion that the woman residing in their house is an impostor, the twins escape from the house and go to a church in a nearby town, where they try to get help from the priest. The priest drives them home, and is satisfied with the woman's explanation that she is their mother.\r\nThe boys tie the woman to the bed and refuse to let her go until she tells them where their real mother is. The woman insists that she is their mother, and the twins burn her face, using a magnifying glass, to try to get her to tell them where their real mother is. They then seal her mouth with tape to keep her from talking or screaming for help.\r\nTwo employees of the Red Cross arrive to collect donations. Although they initially await the return of the mother, they finally leave the house after receiving a large amount of cash from Elias, which he discreetly stole from his mother's purse. Meanwhile, the woman breaks free from the adhesive tape around her mouth and yells for help, but is too late to attract the attention of the Red Cross employees. The twins seal her lips with super glue, only to realize that she is unable to eat. The twins cut open her lips with a small pair of scissors.\r\nAs the woman is still bound and trapped, she wets her bed. The Twins briefly set her free from her shackles to change the bedding, allowing her to subdue the boys and escape. The Twins, however, have set up a booby trap that causes her to fall and hit her head, knocking her unconscious. The woman wakes glued to the living room floor. Elias starts to burn down the house to pressure her into telling them the truth about their mother. The woman firmly insists that she is the Twins' real mother.\r\nThe woman then tells Elias that Lukas had died in an accident prior to her return home, meaning he was a hallucination all along as a coping mechanism and that Elias has gone mad; incapable of accepting his other half's demise. She tearfully explains to Elias that Lukas' death was not his fault and she begs her son to set her free so they can both move on from the tragedy. Elias challenges her to prove that she is their mother by telling them what Lukas is doing. As she cannot see Elias' hallucination of Lukas threatening to set fire to a curtain, she cannot answer the question. So Elias, believing that his real mother could see Lukas, grabs his arm and lights the curtain. The woman subsequently burns to death before firefighters arrive.\r\nThe final shot of the film shows Elias and Lukas walking through the cornfield and emerging to be with their mother, the three of them smiling and embracing, leaving Elias\u2019 fate unclear.\r\nCast\r\nSusanne Wuest as Mutter\r\nElias Schwarz as Elias\r\nLukas Schwarz as Lukas\r\nHans Escher as Priester\r\nElfriede Schatz as Rotkreuz Sammlerin\r\nKarl Purker as Rotkreuz Sammler\r\nGeorg Deliovsky as Pizzalieferant\r\nChristian Steindl as Mesner\r\nChristian Schatz as Bauer\r\nErwin Schmalzbauer as Akkordeongott\r\nReception\r\nThe film generally received positive reviews from critics.
