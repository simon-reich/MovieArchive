Shame was released in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2012.\r\nPlot\r\nBrandon Sullivan is a New York City executive and long-term bachelor. He is a sex addict who frequently has sex with prostitutes and masturbates several times daily, sometimes viewing pornography on his work computers. One day Brandon makes eye contact with a woman wearing an engagement ring on the subway during his morning commute. She initially reciprocates, but becomes uncomfortable. When they exit, she disappears into the crowd. He masturbates in the bathroom afterwards at work. Brandon and his married boss, David, hit on women at a club; later, Brandon has sex on a quiet street with Elizabeth, the woman David was pursuing.\r\nBrandon has been ignoring calls from his sister, Sissy, a lounge singer. He arrives at his apartment startled to find her in his shower with disco music playing, thinking it may have been a burglar. Sissy has a few gigs in the city and asks to stay; he later hears her pleading with her lover on the telephone not to reject her. After Brandon's company computer system is infected with a computer virus, they find his hard drive was full of pornography. David assumes Brandon's intern is responsible.\r\nBrandon rebukes Sissy for balancing precariously on the subway platform edge. Later, he and David watch her perform \"New York, New York\" in a bar, which makes Brandon emotional. David flirts with her and notices the scars of self-inflicted wounds on her arms. Sissy has sex with David in her brother's bedroom while Brandon, disgusted, goes running. Later that night, Sissy attempts to get in bed with Brandon; he orders her out of the room.\r\nBrandon goes on a date with co-worker Marianne, who is recently separated and has a positive attitude toward commitment, while Brandon dislikes the idea of marriage and admits that his relationships have never lasted longer than four months. After dinner they talk about who they would be in a past life. When they reach the subway station, they go home separately.\r\nThat night, Sissy discovers Brandon masturbating in his bathroom. He attacks her and accuses her of spying on him. She finds his laptop open on a pornographic webcam site. Brandon slams the laptop shut and a disturbed Sissy leaves. Brandon disposes of his pornography, sex toys, and laptop. In the office, he kisses Marianne and the two get a hotel room, but Brandon is unable to get an erection. Marianne leaves the hotel. Brandon has aggressive sex with a prostitute in the same hotel room.\r\nBrandon tells Sissy that David has a family, and insists that she leave. She says that, as family, they are supposed to help each other, but Brandon accuses her of being irresponsible and a burden. Brandon goes to a bar and comes on to a woman, describing in explicit sexual detail what he would do to her. She is close to succumbing when her boyfriend intercedes. Brandon laughs in his face and tells him what he was saying. After he leaves the club unsatisfied, the boyfriend follows him out and brutally beats Brandon. When he is physically barred from entering another club, he goes to a gay bar across the street and is fellated by a man. After leaving, he listens to a voicemail message from Sissy crying as she tells him they aren't bad people, but come from a bad place. Brandon has a threesome with two prostitutes.\r\nWhile Brandon is riding the subway home, the passengers are asked to leave the train due to a police emergency, which is implied to be a suicide under the train. He frantically calls Sissy, but she does not answer. He runs home to find Sissy sitting on the bathroom floor covered in blood, having slashed both wrists. He attempts to stop the bleeding while calling on his cellphone for help. She survives and he comforts her in the hospital. After leaving, he walks until he collapses, sobbing in the rain.\r\nBrandon is riding the subway. While looking around, he notices the same woman from the beginning of the film, still wearing the engagement ring. This time, the woman initiates flirting, but Brandon is hesitant. She stands, ready to exit the train at an approaching station. As the train slows, Brandon does not take his eyes off the woman, and the film cuts to black.\r\nCast\r\nMichael Fassbender as Brandon Sullivan\r\nCarey Mulligan as Sissy Sullivan\r\nJames Badge Dale as David\r\nNicole Beharie as Marianne\r\nAlex Manette as Steven\r\nLucy Walters as The Subway Lady\r\nElizabeth Masucci as Elizabeth\r\nAmy Hargreaves as Hotel Lover\r\nHannah Ware as Samantha\r\nRobert Montano as Waiter\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment and casting\r\nMcQueen worked with producer Iain Canning on the 2008 film Hunger and they reunited to develop Shame with Canning and Emile Sherman's UK/Australia-based See-Saw Films. Screenwriter Abi Morgan was chosen to produce the script, making it one of two films she worked on with Film4 (the other being The Iron Lady).\r\nMcQueen's lead actor in Hunger, Michael Fassbender, was the first and only choice to play the lead role in Shame. Actors Carey Mulligan and James Badge Dale joined the cast in December 2010 to play the younger sister and boss, respectively, of Fassbender's character. \"I had so many passes I couldn't even tell you\", said casting director Avy Kaufman, who faced the challenge of casting an NC-17-rated film. Kaufman had a unique assignment from McQueen, who wanted top-quality actors even for tiny parts \u2013 like Brandon's fly-by-night sexual partners. \"The idea was that those partners would propel the story forward with their silence, showing Brandon's state of mind, or even suggesting the history of their relationship with a look or a gesture. The actresses, of course, also had to meet certain physical requirements.\"\r\nFilming\r\nProduction was scheduled to begin on location in New York in January 2011, though Fassbender later commented in an interview that he just began shooting his scenes in early March. A majority of the film was shot in and around Chelsea. The office scenes were filmed in the Citigroup Center and the hotel scenes and nightclub scene were shot at the Standard Hotel in the Meatpacking District.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nA soundtrack was released via Sony Classical Records on 6 December 2011.\r\n\"New York, New York \"Theme\"\" arrangement and production by Stephen Oremus and piano by Liz Caplan\r\nPersonnel\r\nDavid Butterworth \u2013 orchestration (1, 11, 15)\r\nRolf Wilson \u2013 leader (1, 11, 15)\r\nNick Wollage \u2013 engineering, recording, mixing (1, 11, 15)\r\nPete Hutchings \u2013 assistant engineering (1, 11, 15)\r\nManfred Melchior \u2013 mastering\r\nIan Wood \u2013 score editor (1, 11, 15)\r\nIsobel Griffiths \u2013 orchestra contractor (1, 11, 15)\r\nLucy Whalley \u2013 assistant orchestra contractor (1, 11, 15)\r\nWhite Label Productions \u2013 design\r\nSteve McQueen \u2013 liner notes\r\nRelease\r\nShame premiered at The 68th Venice Film Festival in the main competition. Fassbender won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role in the film. It was also screened at The 36th Toronto International Film Festival, The 49th New York Film Festival, The 55th B.F.I. London Film Festival and The 34th Starz Denver Film Festival.\r\nShame was released in the UK on 13 January 2012, after the limited release screening in the US that commenced on 2 December 2011. Fox Searchlight Pictures paid around $400,000 to acquire the United States distribution rights of Shame.\r\nUS rating\r\nThe film was rated NC-17 (no children 17 and under admitted) by the Motion Picture Association of America for some explicit sexual content. Fox Searchlight did not appeal the rating or make cuts for the less restrictive R rating. Searchlight president Steve Gilula said, \"I think NC-17 is a badge of honor, not a scarlet letter. We believe it is time for the rating to become usable in a serious manner\".\r\nReception\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 7.45/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Boasting stellar performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, Shame is a powerful plunge into the mania of addiction affliction.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nRoger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and described it as \"a powerful film\" and \"courageous and truthful\", commenting that \"this is a great act of filmmaking and acting. I don't believe I would be able to see it twice.\" Ebert would later name it his second best film of 2011. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, stating, \"Driven by a brilliant, ferocious performance by Michael Fassbender, Shame is a real walk on the wild side, a scorching look at a case of sexual addiction that's as all-encompassing as a craving for drugs.\"\r\nDan Bullock of The Hollywood News said, \"Shame is captivating and intensely intimate. McQueen has followed Hunger with an unflinching and compelling film that explores the depths of addiction and the consequential destruction and demise of the mind and although it is sometimes difficult to watch, you won't be able to keep your eyes off it.\" Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, commenting, \"A mesmerizing companion piece to his 2008 debut, Hunger, this more approachable but equally uncompromising drama likewise fixes its gaze on the uses and abuses of the human body, as Michael Fassbender again strips himself down, in every way an actor can, for McQueen's rigorous but humane interrogation.\"\r\nWriting in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said, \"McQueen wants to show how the intensity of Brandon's need shuts him off from real intimacy, but this seems to be a foregone conclusion, the result of an elegant experiment that was rigged from the start.\" Donald Clarke of The Irish Times called it \"the most wholesome film made about unwholesomeness since The Exorcist\" noting that \"the underlying current of Puritanism is, however, more than a little oppressive\".\r\nWriting for MUBI, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky said, \u201cEvery scene ladled with big dollops of cinema\u2019s most respectable cop-out: ambiguity \u2026 Shame wears its emptiness like a badge of honor; McQueen is trying for banal blankness, and though he succeeds in that respect, you kind of wish that a filmmaker (and one with a background as an artist at that) would aspire to do more than just say nothing.\u201d\r\nIn the blog for the British journal The Art of Psychiatry, psychiatrist Abby Seltzer praised Mulligan for her portrayal of an individual with borderline personality disorder. While she had initially approached the film warily because of reviews that focused on Brandon's sex addiction, she found it \"a moving and accurate portrayal of psychopathology ... compulsory viewing for all practising clinicians.\"\r\nTop-ten lists\r\n1st \u2013 David Fear, Time Out New York\r\n1st \u2013 Gregory Ellwood, HitFix\r\n2nd \u2013 Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York\r\n2nd \u2013 Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times\r\n2nd \u2013 Marc Savlov, Austin Chronicle\r\n3rd \u2013 Marshall Fine, Hollywood & Fine\r\n3rd \u2013 Peter Knegt, Indiewire\r\n3rd \u2013 James Berardinelli, Reelviews\r\n4th \u2013 Kimberley Jones, Austin Chronicle\r\n5th \u2013 Kate Erbland, Boxoffice Magazine\r\n5th \u2013 Kristopher Tapley, HitFix\r\n5th \u2013 Sasha Stone, Awards Daily\r\n6th \u2013 James Rocchi, Boxoffice Magazine\r\n6th \u2013 Scott Feinberg, The Hollywood Reporter\r\n6th \u2013 Elizabeth Weitzman, New York Daily News\r\n6th \u2013 Christopher Bell, Indiewire\r\n7th \u2013 Liam Lacey and Rick Groen, The Globe and Mail\r\n7th \u2013 Aaron Hills, Village Voice\r\n8th \u2013 Kevin Jagernauth, Indiewire\r\n10th \u2013 Alison Willmore, The A.V.

Fassbender won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role in the film. It was also screened at The 36th Toronto International Film Festival, The 49th New York Film Festival, The 55th B.F.I. London Film Festival and The 34th Starz Denver Film Festival.</p><p>Shame was released in the UK on 13 January 2012, after the limited release screening in the US that commenced on 2 December 2011. Fox Searchlight Pictures paid around $400,000 to acquire the United States distribution rights of Shame.</p><h4>US rating</h4><p>The film was rated NC-17 (no children 17 and under admitted) by the Motion Picture Association of America for some explicit sexual content. Fox Searchlight did not appeal the rating or make cuts for the less restrictive R rating. Searchlight president Steve Gilula said, \"I think NC-17 is a badge of honor, not a scarlet letter. We believe it is time for the rating to become usable in a serious manner\".</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 7.45/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Boasting stellar performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, Shame is a powerful plunge into the mania of addiction affliction.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and described it as \"a powerful film\" and \"courageous and truthful\", commenting that \"this is a great act of filmmaking and acting. I don't believe I would be able to see it twice.\" Ebert would later name it his second best film of 2011. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, stating, \"Driven by a brilliant, ferocious performance by Michael Fassbender, Shame is a real walk on the wild side, a scorching look at a case of sexual addiction that's as all-encompassing as a craving for drugs.\"</p><p>Dan Bullock of The Hollywood News said, \"Shame is captivating and intensely intimate. McQueen has followed Hunger with an unflinching and compelling film that explores the depths of addiction and the consequential destruction and demise of the mind and although it is sometimes difficult to watch, you won't be able to keep your eyes off it.\" Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, commenting, \"A mesmerizing companion piece to his 2008 debut, Hunger, this more approachable but equally uncompromising drama likewise fixes its gaze on the uses and abuses of the human body, as Michael Fassbender again strips himself down, in every way an actor can, for McQueen's rigorous but humane interrogation.\"</p><p>Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said, \"McQueen wants to show how the intensity of Brandon's need shuts him off from real intimacy, but this seems to be a foregone conclusion, the result of an elegant experiment that was rigged from the start.\" Donald Clarke of The Irish Times called it \"the most wholesome film made about unwholesomeness since The Exorcist\" noting that \"the underlying current of Puritanism is, however, more than a little oppressive\".</p><p>Writing for MUBI, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky said, \u201cEvery scene ladled with big dollops of cinema\u2019s most respectable cop-out: ambiguity \u2026 Shame wears its emptiness like a badge of honor; McQueen is trying for banal blankness, and though he succeeds in that respect, you kind of wish that a filmmaker (and one with a background as an artist at that) would aspire to do more than just say nothing.\u201d</p><p>In the blog for the British journal The Art of Psychiatry, psychiatrist Abby Seltzer praised Mulligan for her portrayal of an individual with borderline personality disorder. While she had initially approached the film warily because of reviews that focused on Brandon's sex addiction, she found it \"a moving and accurate portrayal of psychopathology ... compulsory viewing for all practising clinicians.\"</p><h4>Top-ten lists</h4><ul><li>1st \u2013 David Fear, Time Out New York</li><li>1st \u2013 Gregory Ellwood, HitFix</li><li>2nd \u2013 Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York</li><li>2nd \u2013 Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times</li><li>2nd \u2013 Marc Savlov, Austin Chronicle</li><li>3rd \u2013 Marshall Fine, Hollywood & Fine</li><li>3rd \u2013 Peter Knegt, Indiewire</li><li>3rd \u2013 James Berardinelli, Reelviews</li><li>4th \u2013 Kimberley Jones, Austin Chronicle</li><li>5th \u2013 Kate Erbland, Boxoffice Magazine</li><li>5th \u2013 Kristopher Tapley, HitFix</li><li>5th \u2013 Sasha Stone, Awards Daily</li><li>6th \u2013 James Rocchi, Boxoffice Magazine</li><li>6th \u2013 Scott Feinberg, The Hollywood Reporter</li><li>6th \u2013 Elizabeth Weitzman, New York Daily News</li><li>6th \u2013 Christopher Bell, Indiewire</li><li>7th \u2013 Liam Lacey and Rick Groen, The Globe and Mail</li><li>7th \u2013 Aaron Hills, Village Voice</li><li>8th \u2013 Kevin Jagernauth, Indiewire</li><li>10th \u2013 Alison Willmore, The A.V.
