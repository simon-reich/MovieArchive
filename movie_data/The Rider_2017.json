It grossed 3.5 million dollars, making it a small success. The film was critically praised for its story, performances, and its depiction of the people and events that influenced the film.\r\nPlot\r\nBrady lives in poverty with his father Wayne and his younger sister Lilly, who has autism. The people in the film, including Brady and his family, are Lakota Sioux of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Once a rising star in the rodeo circuit, Brady suffered brain damage from an accident at a bronc riding competition, hindering motor functions in his right hand and leaving him prone to seizures. Doctors have told him he can no longer ride, or else his seizures will get worse.\r\nBrady regularly visits his friend Lane, who lives in a care facility after suffering severe brain damage from a similar bullriding accident. Meanwhile, his dad does little to take care of the family, wasting their money away on drinking and gambling. To help keep their trailer, he sells away their horse, Gus, much to Brady's infuriation. Brady, in return, gets a job as a store clerk to help try to raise money for the family.\r\nHe also makes a small living breaking in horses. With his savings, he wants to buy a new horse but his father buys it for him and he forms a very strong bond with the horse, like he had with Gus in the past. However, his constant horse riding and refusal to rest with his brain injury cause him to have a near-fatal seizure. Doctors warn him that if he does not quit riding, he could die. Upon returning home, Brady finds that his horse attempted to escape the fence, permanently injuring one of its legs. Knowing that the horse will never be able to be ridden ever again, he has to ask his father to put him down, after not being able to bring himself to do it.\r\nAfter an argument breaks out with his father, Brady decides to compete in a rodeo competition despite the doctor's warnings. At the competition, before he is about to go next, he spots his father and sister watching him. He finally decides to walk away from the competition and, presumably, his life as a rodeo rider.\r\nCast\r\nBrady Jandreau as Brady Blackburn\r\nTim Jandreau as Wayne Blackburn\r\nLilly Jandreau as Lilly Blackburn\r\nCat Clifford as Cat Clifford\r\nTerri Dawn Pourier as Terri Dawn Pourier\r\nLane Scott as Lane Scott\r\nTanner Langdeau as Tanner Langdeau\r\nJames Calhoon as James Calhoon\r\nRelease\r\nSony Pictures Classics acquired the distribution rights in the U.S. and other territories two days following its premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival.\r\nResponse\r\nBox office\r\nThe Rider grossed $2.4 in the United States and Canada, and $1.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $3.5 million, plus $302,484 with home video sales.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 175 reviews, and an average rating of 8.46/10.
