    "plot": "In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control (Sir John Hurt), resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian Agent, a mole, and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. George Smiley (Gary Oldman) had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by rogue Agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet Intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.",

It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film. The film also received three Oscar nominations: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and for Oldman, Best Actor.\r\nThe novel had previously been adapted into the award-winning 1979 BBC miniseries of the same name with Alec Guinness playing the lead role of Smiley.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1973, \"Control\", head of British intelligence (referred to as \"The Circus\"), sends agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) to Budapest to meet a Hungarian Army general wishing to defect. The general, explains Control, has the name of a mole that the Russians have planted in the British Intelligence Service, \"right at the top\". The meeting turns out to be a trap by Hungarian agents planning to capture Prideaux. Prideaux tries to get away, but is shot.\r\nFollowing the botched assignment, Control is forced out of the Service. He announces that he and his right-hand man, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) will be retiring. Control dies shortly thereafter.\r\nPercy Alleline (Toby Jones) becomes the new Chief, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) his deputy, and Roy Bland (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) his lieutenants. Alleline and Bland meet with Cabinet Office adviser Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney) to request budget approval for an operation, code-named \"Witchcraft\", to obtain highly sensitive information from the Soviet Union. The operation requires a safe house in London in order to protect the identity of the Soviet source. Lacon explains that Prideaux's botched operation in Budapest was a disaster, and further that relations with the CIA are strained because, in their eyes, the British service \"is still a leaky ship.\"\r\nLacon is soon contacted by Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy), a former field agent whose case officer was Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch). Lacon then arranges to meet with Smiley, and explains there is a mole, right at the top of the Circus, and that he has been there for years. Lacon asks Smiley to investigate the matter, and Smiley enlists the help of Guillam, who is still with the Service, and retired Special Branch officer George Mendel (Roger Lloyd-Pack).\r\nSmiley's first step is to visit Control's hotel room, where Smiley and Guillam discover a treasure trove of materials related to investigating the mole. They also discover a set of chess pieces\u2014each labeled with a photograph of Circus leadership (suggesting that Control considered each one of them a suspect\u2014including Smiley). Smiley then recalls a confrontational meeting of Circus leadership (shown in a flashback) in which Alleline discloses what appears to be high-value intelligence on the Soviets. Control explains that the intelligence came from the Witchcraft operation, which Alleline got approval for by going over Control's head. Alleline then brags that he won't tell anyone\u2014pointedly, no one in Circus leadership\u2014who the Soviet source is. The meeting disintegrates.\r\nSmiley then asks Guillam to find personnel records that would show what changes Alleline made after Control and Smiley were forced out. They discover a possible piece of the puzzle\u2014an analyst named Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke) was sacked by Alleline just two weeks after he took over. Smiley arranges to interview Sachs at her house. The meat of Sachs' story is that she became suspicious of Alexei Polyakov (Konstantin Khabensky), a Soviet cultural attach\u00e9, as soon as he arrived in London fifteen years ago. She had information linking Polyakov to a cell in the Soviet Union whose specialty was setting up moles in foreign agencies. She took the information straight to Esterhase and Alleline, who dismissed her suspicions. More to the point, Alleline directed her to leave Polyakov alone. She also shows Smiley a photograph of Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon, calling them \"the inseparables.\"\r\nBack on the trail\u2014researching personnel changes and payments made after Alleline took over\u2014Smiley discovers that the Service made a payment to someone working for the supposedly-deceased Jim Prideaux.\r\nThat night, Smiley returns home, finding that Ricki Tarr has broken into his house\u2014coming out of hiding\u2014to talk to him. In an extended flashback, Tarr describes an assignment in Istanbul. While on assignment, he met a Soviet agent, Irina, who he thought could be turned into a source and with whom he had an affair. Eventually, Irina wanted to exchange information\u2014specifically the identity of the mole\u2014in return for asylum. Tarr went to his station chief and the two of them cabled the Circus to relay Irina's offer, but the cable was not acted on. Soon after, Tarr found the station chief murdered, realising that the mole must have intercepted his message. He tried to warn Irina, but she had already been captured by the Soviets. Fearing for his own life, Tarr went into hiding.\r\nSmiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr cabled. Guillam succeeds in obtaining the book, but while in the building is brought before Circus leadership. Alleline tells Guillam that Tarr is a traitor, a defector, that he betrayed Guillam's own people, that he is in London right now, and that someone has paid him 30,000 pounds. Guillam returns to Smiley, sees Tarr in the room and beats him bloody. After the fray is over, Smiley checks the logbook and discovers that the pages for the night of the cable have been torn out, supporting Tarr's story.\r\nIn another flashback, at a party, Smiley is stunned to see his wife Ann fooling around in the bushes with another party-goer.\r\nSmiley then interviews the duty officer who was in charge on the night that Prideaux was killed. A flashback shows him reporting the news to Control, who failed to respond in any way. Without Control's instructions, the duty officer followed protocol, which included calling Control's second-in-command, Smiley. Smiley wasn't home that night so the duty officer left a message with Smiley's wife, Ann. Bill Haydon arrived soon after and took over, cleaning out all materials related to Prideaux's assignment. Eventually Guillam and Smiley figure out that Haydon was at Smiley's house\u2014with Ann.\r\nHaving guessed that Prideaux is alive, Smiley is able to track him down, now working as a schoolteacher and living in a trailer. The two meet and Prideaux tells his story. Prideaux explains that he was delivered to the KGB, where he was beaten and tortured. His brutal interrogation included watching a woman (Irina) executed right in front of him. Eventually, he was exchanged with the Soviets. Prideaux tells Smiley that his mission in Hungary was to learn the identity of the mole, from the general, and relay it to Control via a code name: \"Tinker\" for Alleline, \"Tailor\" for Haydon, \"Soldier\" for Bland, \"Poorman\" for Esterhase, and \"Beggarman\" for Smiley.\r\nSmiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov\u2014the \"Witchcraft\" source, and the mole's handler\u2014at the safe house somewhere in London, and all four of them have been giving Polyakov \u201clow-grade\u201d British intelligence. Supposedly, Polyakov has been giving them high-grade Soviet intelligence in return, which the British then shared with the CIA in return for high-grade American intelligence. However, the Soviet intelligence is mostly a front\u2014just enough to keep the CIA involved\u2014and the mole (one of the four) has actually been passing to Polyakov substantive material, including high-grade British intelligence as well as the traded-for CIA intelligence.\r\nSmiley drives to an airfield with the Hungarian-born Esterhase and confronts him with what he has learned about the Witchcraft scheme. Smiley threatens to have him deported back to Hungary, unless Esterhase will give up the safe house's location. Esterhase complies.\r\nSmiley goes to the safe house, instructing Tarr to go to the Paris station and cable London, claiming to know who the mole is. As planned, the mole intercepts the cable and stalls for time instead of taking any action. Stalling gives the mole time to go to the safe house and alert Polyakov, where Smiley is lying in wait. Without any struggle or violence, Smiley captures the mole\u2014who is revealed to be Bill Haydon (Tailor).\r\nHaydon explains that Prideaux, his best friend, told him about the operation in Hungary. It was in fact Haydon who persuaded the Soviets to trade him back, rather than kill him. Haydon also confesses his affair with Smiley's wife Ann, trying to explain it as simply an innocent ruse meant to cloud Smiley's judgment. Before Haydon can be traded to the Soviets, Prideaux kills him. Smiley comes home to find his wife in the kitchen, and he becomes the new head of Circus.\r\nCast\r\nGary Oldman as George Smiley (\"Beggarman\")\r\nColin Firth as Bill Haydon (\"Tailor\")\r\nTom Hardy as Ricki Tarr\r\nMark Strong as Jim Prideaux\r\nCiar\u00e1n Hinds as Roy Bland (\"Soldier\")\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam\r\nDavid Dencik as Toby Esterhase (\"Poorman\")\r\nStephen Graham as Jerry Westerby\r\nSimon McBurney as Oliver Lacon\r\nToby Jones as Percy Alleline (\"Tinker\")\r\nJohn Hurt as Control\r\nKathy Burke as Connie Sachs\r\nRoger Lloyd-Pack as Mendel\r\nSvetlana Khodchenkova as Irina\r\nArthur Nightingale as Bryant\r\nJohn le Carr\u00e9 as Christmas party guest\r\nChristian McKay as Mackelvore\r\nKonstantin Khabensky as Polyakov\r\nLinda Marlowe as Mrs McCraig\r\nMichael Sarne as Karla\r\nTomasz Kowalski as Boris\r\nStuart Graham as Minister\r\nZolt\u00e1n Mucsi as Hungarian agent\r\nLaura Carmichael as Sal\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nThe project was initiated by Peter Morgan when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce. Morgan dropped out as the writer for personal reasons but still served as an executive producer. Following Morgan's departure as writer, Working Title hired Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor to redraft the script. Park Chan-wook considered directing the film, but ultimately turned it down. Tomas Alfredson was confirmed to direct on 9 July 2009. The production is his first English language film. The film was backed financially by France's StudioCanal and had a budget corresponding to $21 million. The film is dedicated to O'Connor, who died of cancer during production.\r\nCasting\r\nThe director cast Gary Oldman in the role of George Smiley, and described the actor as having \"a great face\" and \"the quiet intensity and intelligence that's needed\". Many actors were connected to the other roles at various points, but only days before filming started, Oldman was still the only lead actor who officially had been contracted. David Thewlis was in talks for a role early on. Michael Fassbender was in talks at one point to star as Ricki Tarr, but the shooting schedule conflicted with his work on X-Men: First Class; Tom Hardy was cast instead. On 17 September 2010, Mark Strong was confirmed to have joined the cast. Jared Harris was cast but had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows; he was replaced by Toby Jones. John le Carr\u00e9 appears in a cameo as a guest in a party scene.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography took place between 7 October and 22 December 2010. Studio scenes were shot at a former army barracks in Mill Hill, North London. Blythe House in Kensington Olympia, West London, was used as the exterior for \"The Circus.\" The interior hall of Budapest's P\u00e1rizsi Udvar (\"Paris Court\") served as the location for the caf\u00e9 scene, in which Jim Prideaux is shot. Empress Coach Works in Haggerston was used as the location for the Merlin safe house. Other scenes were filmed on Hampstead Heath and in Hampstead Ponds, where Smiley is shown swimming, and in the physics department of Imperial College London.\r\nThe events which take place in Czechoslovakia in the novel were moved to Hungary, because of the country's 20% rebate for film productions. The teams filmed in Budapest for five days. Right before Christmas, the team also filmed in Istanbul for nine days. The production reunited Alfredson with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and editor Dino Jons\u00e4ter, with whom he had made his previous film Let the Right One In.\r\nPost-production and music\r\nThe film took six months to edit. The final song in the film, Julio Iglesias' rendition of the French song \"La Mer\", set against a visual montage of various characters and subplots being resolved as Smiley strides into Circus headquarters to assume command, was chosen because it was something the team thought George Smiley would listen to when he was alone; Alfredson described the song as \"everything that the world of MI6 isn't\". A scene where Smiley listens to the song was filmed, but eventually cut to avoid giving it too much significance.\r\nHeard at a Circus office party, sung along to by the guests, is \"The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World\", composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, and performed by Sammy Davis, Jr., from the British spy spoof Licensed to Kill (1965). At the same office Christmas function, the Circus staff sing the official \"State Anthem of the USSR\", conducted by a figure dressed as Father Christmas but wearing a Lenin mask.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film premiered in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2011. StudioCanal UK distributed the film in the United Kingdom, where it was released on 16 September 2011. The US rights were acquired by Universal Pictures, which owns Working Title, and they passed the rights to their subsidiary Focus Features. Focus planned to give the film a wide release in the United States on 9 December 2011 but pushed it to January 2012, when it was given an 800 screen release.\r\nCritical response\r\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy received generally positive reviews. The film scored 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 223 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's summary called the film \"a dense puzzle of anxiety, paranoia, and espionage that director Tomas Alfredson pieces together with utmost skill\". Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0\u2013100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 85 based on 42 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nJonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, \"The script is a brilliant feat of condensation and restructuring: writers Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor realise the novel is overtly about information and its flow, and reshape its daunting complexity to highlight that\". David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph declared the film \"a triumph\" and gave it a five star rating, as did his colleague, Sukhdev Sandhu. Stateside, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"As Alfredson directs the expert script by Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor, the film emerges as a tale of loneliness and desperation among men who can never disclose their secret hearts, even to themselves. It's easily one of the year's best films.\" M. Enois Duarte of High-Def Digest also praised the film as a \"brilliant display of drama, mystery and suspense, one which regards its audience with intelligence\".\r\nThe Telegraph's Guy Stagg, meanwhile, thought that the movie needed a car chase in the middle. Writing in The Atlantic, le Carr\u00e9 admirer James Parker favourably contrasted Smiley with the James Bond franchise but found this Tinker Tailor adaptation \"problematic\" compared to the 1979 BBC mini-series. He wrote: \"To strip down or minimalize le Carr\u00e9, however, is to sacrifice the almost Tolkienesque grain and depth of his created world: the decades-long backstory, the lingo, the arcana, the liturgical repetitions of names and functions\".\r\nBox office\r\nThe film topped the British box office chart for three consecutive weeks and earned $80,630,608 worldwide.\r\nAwards and honours\r\nPossible sequel\r\nWhile doing press for Working Title's Les Mis\u00e9rables film adaptation, producer Eric Fellner stated that fellow producer Tim Bevan was working with writer Straughan and director Alfredson on developing a sequel to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Fellner did not specify whether or not the sequel would be based on The Honourable Schoolboy or Smiley's People, the two remaining Smiley novels in Le Carr\u00e9's Karla trilogy. While doing press for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014, Oldman stated that talk of a sequel, an adaptation of Smiley's People, had since disappeared; while also stressing that he would still like to see the film produced. However, in July 2016 Oldman confirmed that the sequel was in its early stages, stating, \"There is a script, but I don't know when we will shoot.\"",

They discover a possible piece of the puzzle\u2014an analyst named Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke) was sacked by Alleline just two weeks after he took over. Smiley arranges to interview Sachs at her house. The meat of Sachs' story is that she became suspicious of Alexei Polyakov (Konstantin Khabensky), a Soviet cultural attach\u00e9, as soon as he arrived in London fifteen years ago. She had information linking Polyakov to a cell in the Soviet Union whose specialty was setting up moles in foreign agencies. She took the information straight to Esterhase and Alleline, who dismissed her suspicions. More to the point, Alleline directed her to leave Polyakov alone. She also shows Smiley a photograph of Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon, calling them \"the inseparables.\"</p><p>Back on the trail\u2014researching personnel changes and payments made after Alleline took over\u2014Smiley discovers that the Service made a payment to someone working for the supposedly-deceased Jim Prideaux.</p><p>That night, Smiley returns home, finding that Ricki Tarr has broken into his house\u2014coming out of hiding\u2014to talk to him. In an extended flashback, Tarr describes an assignment in Istanbul. While on assignment, he met a Soviet agent, Irina, who he thought could be turned into a source and with whom he had an affair. Eventually, Irina wanted to exchange information\u2014specifically the identity of the mole\u2014in return for asylum. Tarr went to his station chief and the two of them cabled the Circus to relay Irina's offer, but the cable was not acted on. Soon after, Tarr found the station chief murdered, realising that the mole must have intercepted his message. He tried to warn Irina, but she had already been captured by the Soviets. Fearing for his own life, Tarr went into hiding.</p><p>Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr cabled. Guillam succeeds in obtaining the book, but while in the building is brought before Circus leadership. Alleline tells Guillam that Tarr is a traitor, a defector, that he betrayed Guillam's own people, that he is in London right now, and that someone has paid him 30,000 pounds. Guillam returns to Smiley, sees Tarr in the room and beats him bloody. After the fray is over, Smiley checks the logbook and discovers that the pages for the night of the cable have been torn out, supporting Tarr's story.</p><p>In another flashback, at a party, Smiley is stunned to see his wife Ann fooling around in the bushes with another party-goer.</p><p>Smiley then interviews the duty officer who was in charge on the night that Prideaux was killed. A flashback shows him reporting the news to Control, who failed to respond in any way. Without Control's instructions, the duty officer followed protocol, which included calling Control's second-in-command, Smiley. Smiley wasn't home that night so the duty officer left a message with Smiley's wife, Ann. Bill Haydon arrived soon after and took over, cleaning out all materials related to Prideaux's assignment. Eventually Guillam and Smiley figure out that Haydon was at Smiley's house\u2014with Ann.</p><p>Having guessed that Prideaux is alive, Smiley is able to track him down, now working as a schoolteacher and living in a trailer. The two meet and Prideaux tells his story. Prideaux explains that he was delivered to the KGB, where he was beaten and tortured. His brutal interrogation included watching a woman (Irina) executed right in front of him. Eventually, he was exchanged with the Soviets. Prideaux tells Smiley that his mission in Hungary was to learn the identity of the mole, from the general, and relay it to Control via a code name: \"Tinker\" for Alleline, \"Tailor\" for Haydon, \"Soldier\" for Bland, \"Poorman\" for Esterhase, and \"Beggarman\" for Smiley.</p><p>Smiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov\u2014the \"Witchcraft\" source, and the mole's handler\u2014at the safe house somewhere in London, and all four of them have been giving Polyakov \u201clow-grade\u201d British intelligence. Supposedly, Polyakov has been giving them high-grade Soviet intelligence in return, which the British then shared with the CIA in return for high-grade American intelligence. However, the Soviet intelligence is mostly a front\u2014just enough to keep the CIA involved\u2014and the mole (one of the four) has actually been passing to Polyakov substantive material, including high-grade British intelligence as well as the traded-for CIA intelligence.</p><p>Smiley drives to an airfield with the Hungarian-born Esterhase and confronts him with what he has learned about the Witchcraft scheme. Smiley threatens to have him deported back to Hungary, unless Esterhase will give up the safe house's location. Esterhase complies.</p><p>Smiley goes to the safe house, instructing Tarr to go to the Paris station and cable London, claiming to know who the mole is. As planned, the mole intercepts the cable and stalls for time instead of taking any action. Stalling gives the mole time to go to the safe house and alert Polyakov, where Smiley is lying in wait. Without any struggle or violence, Smiley captures the mole\u2014who is revealed to be Bill Haydon (Tailor).</p><p>Haydon explains that Prideaux, his best friend, told him about the operation in Hungary. It was in fact Haydon who persuaded the Soviets to trade him back, rather than kill him. Haydon also confesses his affair with Smiley's wife Ann, trying to explain it as simply an innocent ruse meant to cloud Smiley's judgment. Before Haydon can be traded to the Soviets, Prideaux kills him. Smiley comes home to find his wife in the kitchen, and he becomes the new head of Circus.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Gary Oldman as George Smiley (\"Beggarman\")</li><li>Colin Firth as Bill Haydon (\"Tailor\")</li><li>Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr</li><li>Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux</li><li>Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Roy Bland (\"Soldier\")</li><li>Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam</li><li>David Dencik as Toby Esterhase (\"Poorman\")</li><li>Stephen Graham as Jerry Westerby</li><li>Simon McBurney as Oliver Lacon</li><li>Toby Jones as Percy Alleline (\"Tinker\")</li><li>John Hurt as Control</li><li>Kathy Burke as Connie Sachs</li><li>Roger Lloyd-Pack as Mendel</li><li>Svetlana Khodchenkova as Irina</li><li>Arthur Nightingale as Bryant</li><li>John le Carr\u00e9 as Christmas party guest</li><li>Christian McKay as Mackelvore</li><li>Konstantin Khabensky as Polyakov</li><li>Linda Marlowe as Mrs McCraig</li><li>Michael Sarne as Karla</li><li>Tomasz Kowalski as Boris</li><li>Stuart Graham as Minister</li><li>Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi as Hungarian agent</li><li>Laura Carmichael as Sal</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>The project was initiated by Peter Morgan when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce. Morgan dropped out as the writer for personal reasons but still served as an executive producer. Following Morgan's departure as writer, Working Title hired Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor to redraft the script. Park Chan-wook considered directing the film, but ultimately turned it down. Tomas Alfredson was confirmed to direct on 9 July 2009. The production is his first English language film. The film was backed financially by France's StudioCanal and had a budget corresponding to $21 million. The film is dedicated to O'Connor, who died of cancer during production.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>The director cast Gary Oldman in the role of George Smiley, and described the actor as having \"a great face\" and \"the quiet intensity and intelligence that's needed\". Many actors were connected to the other roles at various points, but only days before filming started, Oldman was still the only lead actor who officially had been contracted. David Thewlis was in talks for a role early on. Michael Fassbender was in talks at one point to star as Ricki Tarr, but the shooting schedule conflicted with his work on X-Men: First Class; Tom Hardy was cast instead. On 17 September 2010, Mark Strong was confirmed to have joined the cast. Jared Harris was cast but had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows; he was replaced by Toby Jones. John le Carr\u00e9 appears in a cameo as a guest in a party scene.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography took place between 7 October and 22 December 2010. Studio scenes were shot at a former army barracks in Mill Hill, North London. Blythe House in Kensington Olympia, West London, was used as the exterior for \"The Circus.\" The interior hall of Budapest's P\u00e1rizsi Udvar (\"Paris Court\") served as the location for the caf\u00e9 scene, in which Jim Prideaux is shot. Empress Coach Works in Haggerston was used as the location for the Merlin safe house. Other scenes were filmed on Hampstead Heath and in Hampstead Ponds, where Smiley is shown swimming, and in the physics department of Imperial College London.</p><p>The events which take place in Czechoslovakia in the novel were moved to Hungary, because of the country's 20% rebate for film productions. The teams filmed in Budapest for five days. Right before Christmas, the team also filmed in Istanbul for nine days. The production reunited Alfredson with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and editor Dino Jons\u00e4ter, with whom he had made his previous film Let the Right One In.</p><h4>Post-production and music</h4><p>The film took six months to edit. The final song in the film, Julio Iglesias' rendition of the French song \"La Mer\", set against a visual montage of various characters and subplots being resolved as Smiley strides into Circus headquarters to assume command, was chosen because it was something the team thought George Smiley would listen to when he was alone; Alfredson described the song as \"everything that the world of MI6 isn't\". A scene where Smiley listens to the song was filmed, but eventually cut to avoid giving it too much significance.</p><p>Heard at a Circus office party, sung along to by the guests, is \"The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World\", composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, and performed by Sammy Davis, Jr., from the British spy spoof Licensed to Kill (1965). At the same office Christmas function, the Circus staff sing the official \"State Anthem of the USSR\", conducted by a figure dressed as Father Christmas but wearing a Lenin mask.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>The film premiered in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2011. StudioCanal UK distributed the film in the United Kingdom, where it was released on 16 September 2011. The US rights were acquired by Universal Pictures, which owns Working Title, and they passed the rights to their subsidiary Focus Features. Focus planned to give the film a wide release in the United States on 9 December 2011 but pushed it to January 2012, when it was given an 800 screen release.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy received generally positive reviews. The film scored 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 223 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's summary called the film \"a dense puzzle of anxiety, paranoia, and espionage that director Tomas Alfredson pieces together with utmost skill\". Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0\u2013100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 85 based on 42 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, \"The script is a brilliant feat of condensation and restructuring: writers Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor realise the novel is overtly about information and its flow, and reshape its daunting complexity to highlight that\". David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph declared the film \"a triumph\" and gave it a five star rating, as did his colleague, Sukhdev Sandhu. Stateside, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"As Alfredson directs the expert script by Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor, the film emerges as a tale of loneliness and desperation among men who can never disclose their secret hearts, even to themselves. It's easily one of the year's best films.\" M. Enois Duarte of High-Def Digest also praised the film as a \"brilliant display of drama, mystery and suspense, one which regards its audience with intelligence\".</p><p>The Telegraph's Guy Stagg, meanwhile, thought that the movie needed a car chase in the middle. Writing in The Atlantic, le Carr\u00e9 admirer James Parker favourably contrasted Smiley with the James Bond franchise but found this Tinker Tailor adaptation \"problematic\" compared to the 1979 BBC mini-series. He wrote: \"To strip down or minimalize le Carr\u00e9, however, is to sacrifice the almost Tolkienesque grain and depth of his created world: the decades-long backstory, the lingo, the arcana, the liturgical repetitions of names and functions\".</p><h4>Box office</h4><p>The film topped the British box office chart for three consecutive weeks and earned $80,630,608 worldwide.</p><h4>Awards and honours</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"5\">List of awards and nominations</th></tr><tr style=\"background:#ccc;

Fellner did not specify whether or not the sequel would be based on The Honourable Schoolboy or Smiley's People, the two remaining Smiley novels in Le Carr\u00e9's Karla trilogy. While doing press for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014, Oldman stated that talk of a sequel, an adaptation of Smiley's People, had since disappeared; while also stressing that he would still like to see the film produced. However, in July 2016 Oldman confirmed that the sequel was in its early stages, stating, \"There is a script, but I don't know when we will shoot.\"</p><br/>"
