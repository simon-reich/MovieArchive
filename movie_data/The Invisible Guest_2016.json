Arrested by the police in a mountain hotel room with the corpse of his lover at his side, photographer Laura Vidal, Adri\u00e1n talks Virginia about the crime and his relationship with Laura, revealing that both suffered a car crash where a man called Daniel Garrido died, and how Laura manipulated Adri\u00e1n to avoid the jail by Daniel's death. At the same time that F\u00e9lix is looking for a clue that it could change the course of the events, Virginia and Adri\u00e1n keep talking about the case but her, unconvinced of the Adri\u00e1n's testimony, forces him to clear the dark points of his history, in a puzzle where the truth and the lie are easily exchangeable.",

His lawyer, F\u00e9lix Leiva, hires prestigious defense attorney Virginia Goodman who visits him early one morning with the news that the prosecutor has found a witness who will be testifying in front of a judge soon, so he must tell the whole story quickly.\r\nAdri\u00e1n tells Virginia how he and Laura ended their affair months ago but received a call blackmailing them to come to a rural hotel with \u20ac100,000. At the hotel, Adri\u00e1n was knocked unconscious and awoke to find Laura dead in the bathroom. The police arrive and, finding the room door locked and chained from the inside, break in. The windows are locked and the handles removed during the winter, leaving Adri\u00e1n the only suspect. After his arrest, his wife leaves him and takes their young daughter. Virginia insists Adri\u00e1n is not telling her the whole truth.\r\nAdri\u00e1n then narrates further back, how he claimed to be in Paris but was really in a cabin with Laura. As they drive back to Barcelona through Sierra y Ca\u00f1ones de Guara, Adri\u00e1n tries to convince her to end their adulterous relationship. Distracted, Adri\u00e1n swerves into the oncoming lane to avoid a deer, clipping another car, which hits a tree. Although they are unhurt, the driver of the other car, a bank employee named Daniel Garrido, 23, is killed. Laura rationalizes that it is not entirely their fault since Daniel was texting and not wearing his seat belt. When another car approaches, Laura pushes Daniel's body down across the passenger's seat, and she and Adri\u00e1n pretend to exchange insurance information. She answers Daniel's phone when it rings to continue the ruse, and the other driver leaves, convinced. Laura waits for a towtruck in Adri\u00e1n's SUV, which will not start, while Adri\u00e1n dumps Daniel's car in a lake with his body in the trunk.\r\nLaura, upset, returns with his car and tells him how his car was repaired. An automotive engineer, Tom\u00e1s, drove by and offered to help Laura, who claimed she hit a deer. He towed Adrian's car to his house to fix it. While talking to Tom\u00e1s's wife, Elvira, Laura sees some photographs and realizes Daniel Garrido is their son. Laura, who still has Daniel's phone in her pocket, hides it in their couch as Elvira calls, looking for her son. As Laura leaves in Adri\u00e1n's car, Tom\u00e1s Garrido notices her adjusting her seat, proving that she was lying when she claimed she was driving. He notes the car's number plates as Laura leaves. After Adri\u00e1n sells his car and reports it stolen, he parts ways with Laura, hopefully for good.\r\nWithin a few days, Adri\u00e1n is summoned to the police station, as Tom\u00e1s has reported his plate number to the police. F\u00e9lix arranges for a false alibi in Paris and bribes the police to remove Adri\u00e1n's name from the Garrido case file. When the news reports that Daniel is on the run after embezzling money from the bank. Adri\u00e1n confronts Laura who admits that she took Daniel's wallet when they put his body in the trunk. Using his information, Laura, whose husband works for the same bank, hacks into his account and steals money to create a fake trail. Adri\u00e1n tells her that what she is doing is wrong, but Laura threatens to frame him too.\r\nAdri\u00e1n is named European Businessman of the Year, and Tom\u00e1s poses as a reporter during the ceremony to confront him. Tom\u00e1s notices that Adri\u00e1n pulls out the same cigarette lighter he saw when fixing the car. He begs Adri\u00e1n to tell him where his son's body is to bury him as security removes Tom\u00e1s. Days later, Adri\u00e1n receives a photo of a lake with instructions to take Laura to the hotel with \u20ac100,000. Adri\u00e1n thinks the blackmailer may be the driver they saw after the accident, if he followed Adri\u00e1n as he dumped the car.\r\nBack in the present, Virginia suggests that to save himself, Adri\u00e1n could claim he saw the face of the man who hit him in the hotel room and that was Tom\u00e1s. She tells him that there was no surprise witness, and she only told him that to force him to tell the truth. Adri\u00e1n then reveals he had always known it was Tom\u00e1s as he did see his face, but was also testing Virginia.\r\nVirginia suggests planting an item of Laura's in the trunk of his car with Daniel's body, and claiming she acted alone. Adri\u00e1n then confesses that as he was pushing the car into the lake, Daniel woke up, as he was only unconscious; an autopsy would reveal he drowned. Virginia is shocked but states she will not reveal this to the judge.\r\nVirginia says Laura's autopsy shows she was suffering from anxiety, likely from a guilty conscience, and suggests Adri\u00e1n is lying to make it seem like Laura was the mastermind behind their deceit. However, Virginia says she believes Tom\u00e1s framed him because Elvira works at that hotel too, and that is why they chose it. Elvira could have easily unlocked the window for her husband to escape after killing Laura, and later locked the window, making it seem like nobody else came in.\r\nVirginia says Tom\u00e1s has been stalking him, F\u00e9lix and even herself, and points to an apartment across the street, where Tom\u00e1s is lurking. She continues to push Adri\u00e1n who finally admits that he killed Laura and staged the scene.\r\nF\u00e9lix phones and leaves a message on Adri\u00e1n's home voicemail machine, urging him to call back as he was unable to reach him on his cellphone. Virginia suggests he return F\u00e9lix's call as they take a quick 10-minute break. She exits the apartment and begins to quickly walk with great urgency. Adri\u00e1n meanwhile calls F\u00e9lix. F\u00e9lix again says that he could not get a hold of Adri\u00e1n due to his cellphone being off, so he informs him that the prosecution's witness is indeed the other driver, but that F\u00e9lix successfully bought his silence. As F\u00e9lix questions how the meeting with Goodman is going, the call begins to go in and out with high pitched tones, Adri\u00e1n then realizes the pen explodes and stains his shirt with ink due to a signal interruption caused by the cellphone call, revealing that the pen Goodman had given him was bugged and recording their entire conversation. He recalls Goodman turning off his phone previously, most probably so the cellphone signal would not disrupt the recording. He looks into the other apartment and sees Tom\u00e1s standing next to Virginia, who reveals herself to be Elvira Garrido in disguise. Using the confession Elvira coerced from Adri\u00e1n, Tom\u00e1s calls the police as the real Virginia Goodman arrives at Adri\u00e1n's apartment.\r\nCast\r\nMario Casas as Adri\u00e1n Doria, successful businessman, husband and father\r\nB\u00e1rbara Lennie as Laura Vidal, Adri\u00e1n's lover\r\nI\u00f1igo Gastesi as Daniel Garrido \u00c1vila, 23-year-old banker\r\nFrancesc Orella as F\u00e9lix Leiva, Adri\u00e1n's attorney\r\nBlanca Mart\u00ednez as Virginia Goodman, defense attorney hired by F\u00e9lix\r\nJos\u00e9 Coronado as Tom\u00e1s Garrido, Daniel's father\r\nAna Wagener as Elvira Garrido, Daniel's mother\r\nManel Dueso as Inspector Mil\u00e1n\r\nSan Y\u00e9lamos as Sonia, Adri\u00e1n's wife\r\nDavid Selvas as Bruno, Laura's husband\r\nPaco Tous as Conductor\r\nFilming\r\nThe film was shot in 2015, in Terrassa, a city in Catalonia, Spain, and in other locations in Spain such as the city of Barcelona, the region of Biscay, and Vall de N\u00faria.\r\nReception\r\nThe film grossed US$3.9 million in Spain and CN\u00a5172.4 million in China.
