The film also won the BAFTA Awards for Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Production Design and was nominated for Golden Globe awards. It also won a French C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film.\r\nPlot\r\nFrederick Treves, a surgeon at the London Hospital, finds Joseph Merrick in a Victorian freak show in London's East End, where he is kept by Mr. Bytes, an alcoholic, sadistic, despicable and heartless showman. His head is kept hooded, and his \"owner,\" who views him as intellectually disabled, is paid by Treves to bring him to the hospital for examination. Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues and highlights his monstrous skull, which forces him to sleep with his head on his knees, since if he were to lie down, he would asphyxiate. On Merrick's return, he is beaten so badly by Bytes that he has to call Treves for medical help. Treves brings him back to the hospital.\r\nMerrick is tended to by Mrs. Mothershead, the formidable matron, as the other nurses are too frightened of him. Mr. Carr-Gomm, the hospital's Governor, is against housing Merrick, as the hospital does not accept \"incurables.\" To prove that Merrick can make progress, Treves trains him to say a few conversational sentences. Carr-Gomm sees through this ruse, but as he is leaving, Merrick begins to recite the 23rd Psalm, and continues past the part of the Psalm that Treves taught him. Merrick tells the doctors that he knows how to read, and has memorized the 23rd Psalm because it is his favourite. Carr-Gomm permits him to stay, and Merrick spends his time practising conversation with Treves and building a model of a cathedral he sees from his window.\r\nMerrick has tea with Treves and his wife, and is so overwhelmed by their kindness, he shows them his mother's picture. He believes he must have been a \"disappointment\" to his mother, but hopes she would be proud to see him with his \"lovely friends\". Merrick begins to take guests in his rooms, including the actress Madge Kendal, who introduces him to the work of Shakespeare. Merrick quickly becomes an object of curiosity to high society, and Mrs. Mothershead expresses concerns that he is still being put on display as a freak. Treves begins to question the morality of his actions. Meanwhile, a night porter named Jim starts selling tickets to locals, who come at night to gawk at the \"Elephant Man.\"\r\nThe issue of Merrick's residence is challenged at a hospital council meeting, but he is guaranteed permanent residence by command of the hospital's royal patron, Queen Victoria, who sends word with her daughter-in-law Alexandra. However, Merrick is soon kidnapped by Bytes during one of Jim's raucous late-night showings. Bytes leaves England and takes Merrick on the road as a circus attraction once again. A witness reports to Treves who confronts Jim about what he has done, and Mothershead fires him.\r\nMerrick is forced to be an \u2018attraction\u2019 again, but during a \u2018show\u2019 in Belgium, Merrick, who is weak and dying, collapses, causing a drunken Bytes to lock him in a cage and leave him to die. Merrick manages to escape from Bytes with the help of his fellow freakshow attractions. Upon returning to London, he is harassed through Liverpool Street station by several young boys and accidentally knocks down a young girl. Merrick is chased, unmasked, and cornered by an angry mob. He cries, \"I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a ... man!\" before collapsing. Policemen return Merrick to the hospital and Treves. He recovers some of his health, but is dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Treves and Mothershead take Merrick to see one of Mrs Kendal's shows at the theatre, and Kendal dedicates the performance to him. A proud Merrick receives a standing ovation from the audience. Back at the hospital, Merrick thanks Treves for all he has done, and completes his church model. He lies down on his back in bed, imitating a sleeping child in a picture on his wall, and dies in his sleep. Merrick is consoled by a vision of his mother, who quotes Lord Tennyson's \"Nothing Will Die.\"\r\nCast\r\nJohn Hurt as John Merrick, an intelligent, friendly and kind-hearted man who is feared by most people in his society because of his severe deformity\r\nAnthony Hopkins as Frederick Treves, a doctor who takes John from the freakshow to work in the hospital\r\nAnne Bancroft as Madge Kendal\r\nJohn Gielgud as Francis Carr-Gomm\r\nWendy Hiller as Mrs Mothershead\r\nFreddie Jones as Mr Bytes, the ringmaster (based on Tom Norman)\r\nDexter Fletcher as Bytes' boy\r\nMichael Elphick as Jim, the night porter\r\nHannah Gordon as Ann Treves\r\nHelen Ryan as Alexandra, Princess of Wales\r\nJohn Standing as Fox\r\nLesley Dunlop as Nora, Merrick's nurse\r\nPhoebe Nicholls (picture)/Lydia Lisle (footage) as Mary Jane Merrick\r\nMorgan Sheppard as man in pub\r\nKenny Baker as plumed dwarf\r\nPat Gorman as Fairground Bobby\r\nProduction\r\nJonathan Sanger, the film's producer, optioned the script from the writers Christopher Devore and Eric Bergen after receiving the script from his babysitter. Sanger had been working as Mel Brooks' assistant director on High Anxiety. Sanger showed Brooks the script, which he read and decided to help finance the film through Brooksfilms, his new company. Brooks' personal assistant, Stuart Cornfeld, suggested David Lynch to Sanger.\r\nSanger met Lynch and they shared scripts they were working on (The Elephant Man and Lynch's Ronnie Rocket). Lynch told Sanger that he would love to direct the script after reading it, and Sanger endorsed him after hearing Lynch's ideas. However, Brooks had not heard of David Lynch at the time. Sanger and Cornfeld set up a screening of Eraserhead at a screening room at 20th Century Fox, and Brooks loved it and enthusiastically let Lynch direct the film. By his own request, Brooks was not credited as executive producer to ensure that audiences would not expect a comedy after seeing his name attached to the film.\r\n$4 million of the budget was raised from Fred Silverman of NBC. The remaining one million came from EMI Films.\r\nFor his second feature and first studio film albeit independently financed, David Lynch provided the musical direction and sound design. Lynch tried to design the make-up himself too, but the design didn't work. The makeup, now supervised by Christopher Tucker, was directly designed from casts of Merrick's body, which had been kept in the Royal London Hospital\u2019s private museum. The makeup took seven to eight hours to apply each day and two hours to delicately remove. John Hurt would arrive on set at 5am and shoot his scenes from noon until 10pm. When Hurt was having his first experiences with the inconveniences of applying make-up and having to perform with it, he called his wife saying \"I think they finally managed to make me hate acting.\"\r\nBecause of the strain on the actor, he worked alternate days. Lynch originally wanted Jack Nance for the title character. \"But it just wasn't in the cards,\" Lynch says; the role went to John Hurt after Brooks, Lynch and Sanger saw his performance in The Naked Civil Servant as Quentin Crisp.\r\nLynch bookended the film with surrealist sequences centered around Merrick's mother and her death. Lynch used Samuel Barber\u2019s Adagio for Strings to underline the end of the film and Merrick's own death. The film's composer, John Morris, argued against using the music, stating that \"this piece is going to be used over and over and over again in the future...And every time it\u2019s used in a movie it\u2019s going to diminish the effect of the scene.\"\r\nWhen Lynch and Sanger screened The Elephant Man for Brooks after they returned from England with a cut, Brooks suggested some minor cuts but told them that the film would be released as they made it.\r\nThere had been a play about Merrick on Broadway called The Elephant Man, which was enjoying a successful run on Broadway at the time of the film's production. The producers sued Brooksfilms over the use of the title.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nThe Elephant Man was met with critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 91% rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average score of 8.36/10. The site's consensus reads, \"David Lynch's relatively straight second feature finds an admirable synthesis of compassion and restraint in treating its subject, and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.\"\r\nVincent Canby wrote: \"Mr. Hurt is truly remarkable. It can't be easy to act under such a heavy mask ... the physical production is beautiful, especially Freddie Francis's black-and-white photography.\"\r\nA small number of critics were less favorable. Roger Ebert gave it 2/4 stars, writing: \"I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks.\" In the book The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture, Nadja Durbach describes the work as \u201cmuch more mawkish and moralising than one would expect from the leading postmodern surrealist filmmaker\u201d and \u201cunashamedly sentimental\u201d. She blamed this mawkishness on the use of Treves's memoirs as source material.\r\nThe Elephant Man has since been ranked among the best films of the 1980s in Time Out (where it placed 19th) and Paste (56th). The film also received five votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls.\r\nAccolades\r\nThe Elephant Man was nominated for eight Academy Awards, tying with Raging Bull at the 53rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (John Hurt), Art Direction-Set Decoration (Stuart Craig, Robert Cartwright, Hugh Scaife), Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Music: Original Score, and Writing: Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. However, the film did not win any.\r\nPeople in the industry were appalled that the movie was not going to be honored for its make-up effects when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its nominations at the time. A letter of protest was sent to the Academy's Board of Governors requesting to give the film an honorary award. The Academy refused, but in response to the outcry, they decided to give the make-up artists their own category. A year later, the Academy Award for Best Makeup category was introduced with An American Werewolf in London as its first recipient.\r\nIt did win the BAFTA Award for Best Film, as well as other BAFTA Awards for Best Actor (John Hurt) and Best Production Design, and was nominated for four others: Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography and Editing.\r\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\r\n2005: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: John Merrick: \"I am not an animal! I am a human being. I am a man.\" \u2013 Nominated\r\nJohn Merrick: \"I am not an animal! I am a human being. I am a man.\" \u2013 Nominated\r\nHome media\r\nThere have been many releases of the film on VHS, Betamax, CED, LaserDisc, and DVD. The DVD version was released on December 11, 2001 by Paramount Home Entertainment. The version released as part of the David Lynch Lime Green Box includes several interviews with John Hurt and David Lynch and a Joseph Merrick documentary. This material is also available on the exclusive treatment on the European market as part of Optimum Releasing\u2019s StudioCanal Collection. The film has been available on Blu-ray Disc since 2009 throughout Europe and in Australia & Japan but not in the US (however the discs will play in both region A & B players). A 4K restoration (approved by David Lynch) was carried out for the film's 40th anniversary and was released on 4K UHD disc (including a remastered blu-ray) in the UK in April 2020.\r\nThe tie in novel was written by Christine Sparks and published by Ballantine Books in 1980.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nThe musical score of The Elephant Man was composed and conducted by John Morris, and it was performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1980, the company 20th Century Fox Records published this film's original musical score as both an LP album and as a Cassette in the United States. Its front cover artwork features the mask of John Merrick against a backdrop of smoke, as seen on the advance theatrical poster for the film.\r\nIn 1994, the first Compact disc (CD) issue of the film score was made by the company Milan, which specializes in film scores and soundtrack albums.\r\nTrack listing for the first U.S. release on LP\r\nSide one\r\nSide two\r\nCultural influence\r\nThe Jam's former bassist Bruce Foxton was inspired strongly by the film, and in response wrote the song \"Freak\" with the single's cover even making a reference to the film.\r\nActor Bradley Cooper credits watching the movie with his father as a child as his inspiration to become an actor. Cooper played the character on Broadway in 2013.\r\nMusician Steven Wilson has stated The Elephant Man to be his favorite film of all time.\r\nIn season three, episode twenty one of The Simpsons, \"Black Widower\", Lisa daydreams of Aunt Selma new boyfriend as the Elephant Man.\r\nBritish TV presenter Karl Pilkington often has cited it as his favorite film. Pilkington's love for the film brought many new features to his various podcasts and radio shows.",

The film's composer, John Morris, argued against using the music, stating that \"this piece is going to be used over and over and over again in the future...And every time it\u2019s used in a movie it\u2019s going to diminish the effect of the scene.\"</p><p>When Lynch and Sanger screened The Elephant Man for Brooks after they returned from England with a cut, Brooks suggested some minor cuts but told them that the film would be released as they made it.</p><p>There had been a play about Merrick on Broadway called The Elephant Man, which was enjoying a successful run on Broadway at the time of the film's production. The producers sued Brooksfilms over the use of the title.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs expansion</b>. <small>You can help by <span class=\"external text\">adding to it</span>.</small>  <small class=\"date-container\"><i>(<span class=\"date\">November 2014</span>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Critical response</h4><p>The Elephant Man was met with critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 91% rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average score of 8.36/10. The site's consensus reads, \"David Lynch's relatively straight second feature finds an admirable synthesis of compassion and restraint in treating its subject, and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.\"</p><p>Vincent Canby wrote: \"Mr. Hurt is truly remarkable. It can't be easy to act under such a heavy mask ... the physical production is beautiful, especially Freddie Francis's black-and-white photography.\"</p><p>A small number of critics were less favorable. Roger Ebert gave it 2/4 stars, writing: \"I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks.\" In the book The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture, Nadja Durbach describes the work as \u201cmuch more mawkish and moralising than one would expect from the leading postmodern surrealist filmmaker\u201d and \u201cunashamedly sentimental\u201d. She blamed this mawkishness on the use of Treves's memoirs as source material.</p><p>The Elephant Man has since been ranked among the best films of the 1980s in Time Out (where it placed 19th) and Paste (56th). The film also received five votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls.</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>The Elephant Man was nominated for eight Academy Awards, tying with Raging Bull at the 53rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (John Hurt), Art Direction-Set Decoration (Stuart Craig, Robert Cartwright, Hugh Scaife), Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Music: Original Score, and Writing: Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. However, the film did not win any.</p><p>People in the industry were appalled that the movie was not going to be honored for its make-up effects when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its nominations at the time. A letter of protest was sent to the Academy's Board of Governors requesting to give the film an honorary award. The Academy refused, but in response to the outcry, they decided to give the make-up artists their own category. A year later, the Academy Award for Best Makeup category was introduced with An American Werewolf in London as its first recipient.</p><p>It did win the BAFTA Award for Best Film, as well as other BAFTA Awards for Best Actor (John Hurt) and Best Production Design, and was nominated for four others: Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography and Editing.</p><p>The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:</p><ul><li>2005: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: John Merrick: \"I am not an animal! I am a human being. I am a man.\" \u2013 Nominated</li><li>John Merrick: \"I am not an animal! I am a human being. I am a man.\" \u2013 Nominated</li></ul><br/><h3>Home media</h3><p>There have been many releases of the film on VHS, Betamax, CED, LaserDisc, and DVD. The DVD version was released on December 11, 2001 by Paramount Home Entertainment. The version released as part of the David Lynch Lime Green Box includes several interviews with John Hurt and David Lynch and a Joseph Merrick documentary. This material is also available on the exclusive treatment on the European market as part of Optimum Releasing\u2019s StudioCanal Collection. The film has been available on Blu-ray Disc since 2009 throughout Europe and in Australia & Japan but not in the US (however the discs will play in both region A & B players). A 4K restoration (approved by David Lynch) was carried out for the film's 40th anniversary and was released on 4K UHD disc (including a remastered blu-ray) in the UK in April 2020.</p><p>The tie in novel was written by Christine Sparks and published by Ballantine Books in 1980.</p><br/><h3>Soundtrack</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"summary album\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic; background-color: gainsboro\">The Elephant Man</th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"><div>Cover of the original vinyl edition</div></td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"description\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: gainsboro\"><span>Film score</span> by <div class=\"contributor\" style=\"display:inline\"><span>John Morris</span></div></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Released</th><td class=\"published\">1980, 1981, 1994, 2008</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Genre</span></th><td class=\"category hlist\"><span>Classical</span></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Label</span></th><td class=\"hlist\"><span>20th Century Fox</span></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Producer</span></th><td class=\"hlist\"><span>John Morris</span></td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"description\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: gainsboro\"><span>John Morris</span> chronology</th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"><table style=\"background: transparent; width: 100%; min-width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse\"><tbody><tr style=\"line-height: 1.4em;\"><td style=\"width: 33%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; padding: .2em .1em .2em 0\"><i><span>In God We Tru$t</span></i><br>(1980)</td><td style=\"width: 33%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; padding: .2em .1em\"><i><b>The Elephant Man</b></i><br>(1980)</td><td style=\"width: 33%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; padding: .2em 0 .2em .1em\"><i><span>History of the World, Part I</span></i><br>(1981)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The musical score of The Elephant Man was composed and conducted by John Morris, and it was performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra.
