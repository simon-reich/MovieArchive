Nonetheless, the film marked the final project for Paramount Vantage before it closed in December 2013.\r\nPlot\r\nIn Billings, Montana, a police officer arrives and discovers Woody Grant walking on the shoulder of the roadway. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money.\r\nAfter Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay.\r\nWhile in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway.\r\nThey stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some beers at a bar. When David brings up Woody's alcoholism and problems within the family\u2014with Woody implying that he did not love Kate nor really want children\u2014they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire.\r\nKate arrives by bus in Hawthorne, where David escorts his parents to the cemetery. Kate pays her respects there while providing some colorful history on Woody's relatives, particularly their sex lives. A local newspaper owner wants to run a story about Woody and his sweepstakes \"victory.\" She is an old girlfriend of Woody's and provides David with some background about his father. That night, Ed corners David in the men's room about some money Ed loaned Woody years ago that he wants back, threatening legal action.\r\nThe rest of Woody's family, including Ross, come to visit him. Cole and Bart, and others approach David and Ross about their share of the money that they believe Woody owes them. A fight begins, ending abruptly with Kate calling out the relatives for their own unpaid debts. David, Kate, Ross and Woody tour the latter's childhood home, which has fallen into disrepair. They drive past a house Kate identifies as Ed's, so David and Ross conspire to steal back the air compressor. Kate soon realizes that the house actually belongs to another couple. She distracts the homeowners so David and Ross can quickly return the stolen compressor.\r\nAt the bar, asking Woody for money, Ed reveals that Woody cheated on Kate before David's birth. As they leave, they are attacked by a masked Bart and Cole, who escape with the sweepstakes letter. They later tell David they threw it away after finding out it was a scam. Nevertheless, David and Woody go searching for it. They enter a bar where they find Ed reading the letter aloud to the other patrons, humiliating Woody. After Woody takes the letter back and goes outside, David punches Ed in the face.\r\nWoody has repeatedly said he wants to buy a truck with the money. He cannot drive any more, but Woody tells his son that he also wants to leave something for his family when he dies. David says that they are not going to Lincoln, at which point Woody collapses. David takes him to the hospital in Norfolk. In the middle of the night, Woody abruptly leaves and starts walking, so David relents and drives Woody to Lincoln.\r\nThey arrive at the marketing agency, where they are told that Woody did not have the winning number. He is given a consolation gift of a hat that reads \"Prize Winner\". David goes to an auto dealership and trades in his Subaru for a late-model truck that his father always wanted, along with a new Craftsman air compressor. While driving back through Hawthorne, David lets Woody take the wheel for all to see, hiding below the dash to allow Woody to feel that his days of independence are not over yet. Among them is Woody's former flame who smiles at him, a nonplussed Ed with a black eye, and Woody's brother Albert. Woody waves goodbye and drives out of town, then stops in the middle of the road and switches seats with David, who takes them the rest of the way back home.\r\nCast\r\nBruce Dern as Woodrow T. \"Woody\" Grant, David and Ross' father, and Kate's husband\r\nWill Forte as David Grant, Woody and Kate's youngest son, and Ross' brother\r\nJune Squibb as Kate Grant, Woody's wife, and Ross and David's mother\r\nBob Odenkirk as Ross Grant, Woody and Kate's oldest son, David's brother and a local television news anchor\r\nStacy Keach as Ed Pegram, Woody's business partner\r\nMary Louise Wilson as Aunt Martha, Woody's sister-in-law\r\nMissy Doty as Noel, David's former girlfriend\r\nAngela McEwan as Pegy Nagy, Woody's former girlfriend\r\nRance Howard as Uncle Ray, one of Woody's brothers\r\nMelinda Simonsen as the Receptionist in Lincoln.\r\nProduction\r\nScreenplay\r\nWhile in production on About Schmidt, Alexander Payne was given Bob Nelson's screenplay by producers Albert Berger and Ron Yerxa, asking him to recommend a director. He asked to direct it himself, but did not want to follow up one road trip film (Sideways, on which he was in pre-production) with another. He decided to wait until after completing The Descendants to pick up this project. This was the first film of Payne's in which he was not directly involved in the screenwriting, and he rewrote only a few things prior to the beginning of filming.\r\nCasting\r\nAfter first reading the script, Payne thought of Bruce Dern for the role of the elderly father Woody Grant. As casting for the film began, Payne met with over fifty actors. Because Paramount demanded a big star, Gene Hackman, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Jack Nicholson, and Robert Forster were initially short listed for the role. Hackman had retired, and Duvall and De Niro were indisposed on other projects. Payne eventually considered Dern again. The director chose this actor because, as he said:\r\nThe role of son David Grant was desired by several notable Hollywood actors. Bryan Cranston read for the role, but Payne considered him a bad fit. Other considered candidates for the role included Paul Rudd, Casey Affleck, and Matthew Modine, who spoke publicly of being considered. Payne later selected Will Forte, despite rumors that a high-profile actor was wanted. Payne stated he cast the comedian because:\r\nFilming\r\nThe film was shot with Arri Alexa digital cameras and Panavision C-Series anamorphic lenses. The film's lighting was designed to accommodate black and white screening, and was converted from color to black and white in post-production because Payne said he wanted to produce an \"iconic, archetypal look\". According to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, the choice was to use \"the poetic power of the black and white in combination with these landscapes and of course the landscapes are playing a huge role in this story\". The choice of black and white was made against distributor Paramount Vantage's wishes, though a color master of the film was also produced in an effort to satisfy the concerns; Payne said that he hopes no one ever sees it. Despite this, the network Epix announced in August 2014 that it would show the color version as a \"limited time showing\".\r\nNebraska started filming in locations in its namesake state in November 2012. Filming moved to Billings, Montana; Buffalo, Wyoming; and Rapid City, South Dakota, and wrapped in December after a 35-day shoot. Nebraska communities where filming took place include Allen, Battle Creek, Elgin, Hooper, Lincoln, Lyons, Madison, Norfolk, Osmond, Pierce, Plainview, Stanton, and Tilden. The premiere in the namesake state was in Norfolk on November 25, 2013.\r\nMusic\r\nThe film score to Nebraska was composed by Tin Hat member Mark Orton. The score also includes performances by other members of Tin Hat, providing the first time the three original members have reunited since 2005. A soundtrack album was released by Milan Records on November 19, 2013.\r\nRelease\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 229 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Elegant in its simplicity and poetic in its message, Nebraska adds another stirringly resonant chapter to Alexander Payne's remarkable filmography.\" On Metacritic, film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nIn his review following the Cannes Film Festival, Robbie Collin at The Daily Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"a bittersweet elegy for the American extended family, shot in a crisp black-and-white that chimes neatly with the film's concern for times long past.\" He also said the film was \"a resounding return to form for Payne\". Peter Bradshaw at The Guardian wrote that Payne had \"returned to a more natural and personal movie language\", and praised Dern's performance. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal noted that \"Bruce Dern's portrait of the boozy old coot is a wonder, as well as the capstone, thus far, of that singular actor's career.\" Writing for Roger Ebert's website, Christy Lemire commented, \u201cThe film's starkly beautiful final images have a poignancy that might leave a lump in your throat.\u201d\r\nAccolades\r\nNebraska has received several awards and nominations since its release. The American Film Institute included it in their Top Ten Films of the Year. The cast won Best Ensemble from the Boston Society of Film Critics, while Squibb won Best Supporting Actress. Nebraska has received five Golden Globe nominations. It also earned six nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards. Dern and Forte won Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively at the National Board of Review. Nebraska has gathered three Satellite Award nominations and has won Best Cast and Best Supporting Actress for Squibb. The film received two nominations from the Screen Actors Guild Awards.",
