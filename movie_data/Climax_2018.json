They then make one last party around a large sangria bowl. Quickly, the atmosphere becomes charged and a strange madness will seize them the whole night. If it seems obvious to them that they have been drugged, they neither know by who nor why. And it's soon impossible for them to resist to their neuroses and psychoses, numbed by the hypnotic and the increasing electric rhythm of the music. While some feel in paradise, most of them plunge into hell.",

The film received positive reviews, with many critics praising its direction, cinematography, soundtrack, choreography, and performances, although some criticized its violence and perceived lack of story.\r\nPlot\r\nA series of audition tapes is depicted, in which choreographer Selva and DJ Daddy interview potential future members of a dance troupe they are creating. They discuss topics like dance, fears, relationships, sex, and drug experiences. One night during the winter season in 1996, in an abandoned school, the collected dancers rehearse an elaborate routine before starting an after-party. They dance and drink sangria made by the troupe manager, Emmanuelle. The diverse group has several personal issues and share gossip about one another during the celebration.\r\nAs the party progresses, the dancers get increasingly more agitated and confused and eventually come to the conclusion that the sangria has been spiked with LSD. At first they accuse Emmanuelle since she made the drink, but she points out that she drank it and is also suffering from its effects. Taylor, already resentful towards Omar for dating his sister Gazelle, points out that Omar, a non-drinker, has not touched the sangria and accuses him of being the one responsible. The group gets angry and locks him outside the building in freezing conditions.\r\nEmmanuelle sees her young son, Tito, who is present at the rehearsals, drink the sangria and locks him inside an electrical room to protect him from the agitated dancers. Selva goes to the room of her friend Lou, where Lou confesses that she did not drink because she is pregnant. However, Dom, strongly affected by the drug, enters the room, accuses Lou of spiking the drink and kicks her several times in the stomach; Lou, hurt and in great pain both emotional and physical, passes through an altercation between Alaia and Jennifer, during which Jennifer's hair is set aflame after Alaia gets physically aggressive due to Jennifer's refusal to share her cocaine.\r\nA frenzied Lou confronts Dom with a knife on the dance floor, but the group, all heavily affected by the LSD at this point, turns on her and accuses her of having spiked the drink. Suffering an emotional breakdown, Lou ends up beating her own stomach and slices herself superficially with the knife on her face and arm after the group encourages her to kill herself. Emmanuelle, who has lost the key to the electric room in which Tito is locked, recklessly tries to free her son. When the school suddenly loses power, she realises that Tito\u2014who is no longer screaming from the other side of the door\u2014has electrocuted himself.\r\nIvana brings a heavily hallucinating Selva to Ivana's room where the two take shelter and have sex. David discovers the two and is kicked out. David tries to enter DJ Daddy's room but is also evicted. Rejected, David encounters Gazelle as her brother, Taylor, attempts to have sex with her. Gazelle flees from Taylor and stumbles into the central hall where the remaining dancers have truly lost their minds, dancing, writhing on the floor, chanting in tongues, having sex with one another, or beating each other up. Taylor catches up to Gazelle and takes her to his room while David is attacked by another dancer who slams his head against the floor.\r\nWhen police arrive the next morning, they find a majority of the dancers unconscious. Omar has frozen to death outside while Emmanuelle has killed herself outside the electrical room out of grief. Gazelle wakes up next to Taylor, seemingly having forgotten the evening. A bloody Lou exits the building, and writhes outside in snow laughing uncontrollably. As the police search the building, Psych\u00e9, who has several books related to hallucinogens in her bag, and has had an apparent lack of suffering from acid, goes to her room and drops drugs into her eyes.\r\nCast\r\nSofia Boutella as Selva\r\nRomain Guillermic as David\r\nSouheila Yacoub as Lou\r\nKiddy Smile as Daddy\r\nClaude Gajan Maull as Emmanuelle\r\nGiselle Palmer as Gazelle\r\nTaylor Kastle as Taylor\r\nThea Carla Sch\u00f8tt as Psych\u00e9\r\nSharleen Temple as Ivana\r\nL\u00e9a Vlamos as Eva\r\nAla\u00efa Alsafir as Ala\u00efa\r\nKendall Mugler as Rocket\r\nLakdhar Dridi as Riley\r\nAdrien Sissoko as Omar\r\nMamadou Bathily as Bart\r\nAlou Sidibe as Kyrra\r\nAshley Biscette as Shirley\r\nMounia Nassangar as Dom\r\nTiphanie Au as Sila\r\nSarah Belala as Jennifer\r\nAlexandre Moreau as Cyborg\r\nNaab as Rocco\r\nStrauss Serpent as Serpent\r\nVince Galliot Cumant as Tito\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of a French dance troupe in the 1990s who had their alcoholic beverage spiked with LSD at an after-party; however, no further incidents took place during the actual event, unlike in the film. The idea of making a film based around dance came to No\u00e9 in late November/December 2017, when he was invited to a vogue ballroom by L\u00e9a Vlamos (who would eventually be a part of the film's cast): \"I couldn\u2019t believe the energy and the crowd \u2013 and then I thought, I\u2019d love to film these kind of people. I\u2019d also seen that movie by David LaChapelle called Rize, about krumping. I was amazed by these young kids dancing like they were possessed by evil forces.\" Although he originally felt inspired to make a documentary film about dance, he came up with the idea of Climax in early January 2018. He used 1970s films for additional inspiration, including The Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure and Shivers.\r\nHe stated that the film was \"all about people creating something together, and failing in the second half. It\u2019s like the story of the Tower of Babel. Mankind can create big things. And then with the influence of alcohol, or some accident, everything falls. I remember as a teenager when I was 14, I would host parties at my home. And I liked sangria, it was the first alcohol I ever drank. But you seriously don\u2019t need drugs to lose control, alcohol is more than enough. I\u2019ve seen so many more fights linked to alcohol \u2013 it can turn you crazy.\" In another interview, he claimed that the theme of the film was \"a group people creating something together and then collapsing.\" No\u00e9, who had experience using LSD, claimed that the film was more about the impact fear can have on people than it was about drug abuse. He also denied that the film had any kind of moral agenda, pointing out that \"It is not necessarily the most aggressive ones that get punished. It's mostly about a collective screw-up.\"\r\nPre-production\r\nIn early January 2018, No\u00e9 had the idea of starting the production of Climax right away, and to make the film much faster than in typical productions. Producers Vincent Maraval (who had produced No\u00e9's previous two films Enter the Void and Love) and Edouard Weil agreed, under the condition that No\u00e9 would keep the production very short and film it for cheap. No\u00e9 stated: \"The whole project happened very quickly. We started casting and preparing the movie at the beginning of January, and we were shooting one month later in an abandoned school in a suburb in Paris. It was the most joyful and quick shooting I\u2019ve ever done.\" He was able to quickly find a crew, made up of people that he had worked with before or had wanted to work with for a long time. The crew included cinematographer Beno\u00eet Debie, assistant director Claire Cobetta, and set decorator Jean Rabasse.\r\nCasting\r\nThe film was cast over the month of January 2018. It was mostly made of dancers with no acting experience, as No\u00e9 found the cast himself mostly in ballrooms, krumping battles, or on the internet. As vogue and krumping are largely individual dances, most of the cast had no experience dancing as a group, or in synchronization. When asked about the casting process for the film, Noe said \"I went to see some voguing ballrooms and krump battles, and I was hypnotized by their body language. These guys, who are usually very poor, become stars onstage once a month in a ballroom or in a battle.\"\r\nThe film's choreographer, Nina Mc Neely, is the one who had the idea of casting Sofia Boutella. The only cast members with acting experience were Sofia Boutella and Souheila Yacoub; Boutella had been a dancer for many years, although she had stopped dancing a few years before, and agreed to do it again for the film. One of the cast members was a contortionist in Congo No\u00e9 had heard of when searching for unusual dancers, and got into touch with before flying him to France. An agent brought up Yacoub when No\u00e9 asked for a dancer who would be \"able to scream and shout on demand I met her and we did a quick casting to see how much she could scream and dance... and she was excellent and I was like can you start on Monday... she thought I was joking at first.\" He recognized that the characters played by Boutella and Yacoub \"would have been too hard someone who is not really an actor, as they were more complicated psychologically.\"\r\nFilming\r\nClimax was shot in 15 days in an abandoned school in Paris. Although No\u00e9 conceived a basic story, and gave the cast ideas as to where the story and characters could go, he did not write any lines, and let the cast improvise the dialogue and most of the situations in front of the camera; there were no rehearsals, and only the premise, the characters' basic personality traits, and the early dance scene had been planned beforehand. He stated that when the cast asked him for a script so they could learn their lines, he answered, \"No, just come to the set and do whatever you want, I\u2019ll never push you to do anything against your will and if you have any ideas please tell them to me.\" No\u00e9 did give several ideas to the cast, but let them be free to follow them or not: \"I knew the start and the end point, but I didn\u2019t know the in-between. For example, initially I thought Sofia Boutella\u2019s character, Selma, would end up with a boy, then I thought maybe it could be a girl. When I met the Russian girl dancer and I asked Sofia if she minds ending up with her, she didnt... so the whole thing was quite organic. Then I didn\u2019t know how the story of the DJ would end... oh maybe he ends with the young dancer... But everything was shot in chronological order, which keeps the door open for any kind of re-writing.\" He stated that \"The mood on set was so joyful and friendly. People were not getting wasted. I asked them what you would enjoy doing in the movie? How would you want to shock an audience? I would never ask them to do, what they would not like doing. Tell me who you want to kiss? Who you want to smash? Who you want to insult? And I would ask the other person, would you mind if this person wants to do this or that. And of-course the reciprocal person was welcome to anything.\"\r\nAfter the opening scene and the audition tapes, the plot of the film starts with a long take lasting over 12 minutes, with the first five minutes consisting of a fully choreographed dance by the cast. The choreography had also not been rehearsed before shooting, with the cast improving the dance and adding to it with each take, with the help of McNeely and the rest of the crew. They eventually filmed sixteen takes, with the fifteenth being the one used in the film; No\u00e9 stated that the final two takes were the only ones good enough to be used. Another long take central to the film lasts over 42 minutes, almost half of the film's running time; No\u00e9 stated that \"I was operating the camera but I had no idea how I was going to frame the scenes until immediately before I was on the set. I especially wanted the second half of the movie to be one continuous master shot, but how it was going to be I had no idea.\"\r\nAbout the opening shot, in which Lou is seen screaming in the snow and the end credits roll, No\u00e9 stated: \"I look at a book and there is a prologue, or at the end an epilogue, a bibliography, or an additional personal note. In the case of this movie, the first exaggerated scene with her being bloody, crying in the snow, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. It was just snowing in Paris for two days and the second day, I thought about possibly taking advantage of the weather. We got a drone and filmed the girl in the snow from above. I didn\u2019t know how to use that footage at first. Later in the movie when they open the door, I thought that could fit in with the previous footage, if we made it snow outside and make it look like they were locked in. So I got some snow machines to re-create the whole thing. When people mentioned that there was some reference to The Shining it wasn\u2019t that at all. I liked the idea of getting rid of the credits at the beginning of the movie. I hate ending credits. I like movies from the 40s, 50s of which movies would end abruptly. So, I knew how I wanted to end the movie. I found like a satanic icon that I could put before the movie starts. Like an omen, that\u2019s something is going to turn bad, there was going to be a big drama, that the world is going to turn to hell.\"\r\nThere was no clear ending in mind while the actors were improvising. According to No\u00e9, the only narrative directive given to the cast about the end of the story was that \"the most fragile ones would die at the end! Only the strong survive.\" The interview tapes featured early in the film were not originally planned, but No\u00e9's line producer suggested that the cast should have talked more in the film, and came up with the idea of interviewing them for possible extra footage for the home media release; it was eventually added to the film. Those scenes were also completely improvised.\r\nWhile he had also featured drugs in previous films, No\u00e9 decided to have a different approach in Climax: \"I didn\u2019t want to do any visual or sound effects to reproduce the feeling you are having when you\u2019re on drugs. I thought it would be funny to do it the other way, like shoot almost documentary style with long cuts, seeing how the effects of drugs and alcohol are experienced, how its seen from the outside. Like how it all shows and not how it feels.\" He also left the cast free to have their characters react to LSD in whichever way they preferred, as people can react very differently to it in real life: \"They were all quite keen to get to the second part of the shoot, with the drugs and everything going crazy. I showed them all these videos; people high on LSD, mushrooms, crack, whatever. Then after, I asked each one how they would want to portray their own craziness.\"\r\nRelease\r\nThe film premiered on 13 May 2018 at the Cannes Film Festival, screening in the Directors' Fortnight section where it won the Art Cinema Award.\r\nThe film was released in France on 19 September 2018 by Wild Bunch Distribution and in Belgium on 21 November 2018 by O'Brother Distribution. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2018 by Arrow Films, and in the United States on 1 March 2019 by A24.\r\nMarketing\r\nFor the premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the promotional material for the film humorously addressed the polarising responses and controversies surrounding No\u00e9's previous films, stating: \"You despised I Stand Alone, hated Irr\u00e9versible, execrated Enter the Void, cursed Love, come celebrate Climax.\" A VHS of the film was sold for a limited stock of 100 by A24.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nClimax grossed $817,339 in the United States and Canada, and $1.2 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $2 million, against a production budget of 2.9 million.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 174 reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Challenging and rewarding in equal measure, Climax captures writer-director Gaspar No\u00e9 working near his technically brilliant and visually distinctive peak.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". No\u00e9's direction, Beno\u00eet Debie's cinematography, the film's music, and the performances (both in terms of acting and dance) were praised; Boutella, in particular, was singled out. However, some criticised the film's violence and story. Critics agreed that the film had a unique style, but while most found it to be a quality, other reviewers heavily disliked it.\r\nIn a positive review, Joseph Walsh of Time Out stated: \"Inventive and seductive, this infernal chamber piece will be sure to divide opinion. The camera plunges into the chaos, melding physical theatre with a palette of fiendish reds and impish greens, all accompanied by throbbing techno. Part musical, part political treatise, and with more than a wink to Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, No\u00e9 is at his most decadent and devilish.\" Hau Chu of The Washington Post also gave a positive review, stating that \"No\u00e9 has made what might be his most accessible and, yes, tender film to date, teasing the idea of heavenly bliss - before heading straight to hell.\"\r\nRay Pride of Newcity gave a very positive review, stating: \"Climax is a rude, refined, gyroscopic, hurtling mash-up... of heaven and hell a bravura dance number with a ravishing range of bodies in orchestrations of sensual motion and the camera brandishing its lavish mobility for moments on end.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper was less positive: although he highly praised the various dance scenes, calling them \"a jarring, beautiful, dangerously adventurous symphony of arms and legs and torsos, bursting with originality and sexuality and almost violent physicality, all set to a relentless and seemingly endless hip-hop beat. Seriously great stuff\", he criticized the dialogue and horror scenes, stating that the film \"turns into a sick circus of atrocities\", which \"just as often is more annoying and attention-seeking than dramatically effective, and the increasingly absurdist storyline. Alas, with the notable exception of the empathetic Boutella, the cast of Climax consists primarily of dancers who are not actors. And as actors, they\u2019re really good dancers.\"\r\nScott Craven of The Arizona Republic panned the film, rating it 1 out of 5 and stating, \"Climax is actually two movies, one in which you hang out at a party with young dancers who are as wearisome as they are flexible, and the other with the same group on acid. Neither is the least bit interesting. Gaspar Noe doesn\u2019t care what you think. He make movies to provoke, if not to inspire annoyance, even hate. When a mom locks her young son in an electrical closet (inside is a menacing circuit panel that, if animate, would swallow the child whole), even those without kids cringe as the boy screams for help. Noe laughs at your discomfort.\" He concluded saying: \"You just have to figure out if it's a ride you want to take\".\r\nRegarding the overall positive response to Climax, unlike most of his films which were more polarizing or controversial, No\u00e9 stated jokingly: \"I must be doing something wrong. I have to take a long holiday and rethink my career.\" In another he claimed: \"Even my father tell me it's his favorite film, and there's a lot of directors who told me it was my best film. I never worked so little on something and I was never congratulated so much.\"\r\nAccolades",
            "html": "<h2>Climax (2018 film)</h2><p>Climax is a 2018 psychological horror film directed, written and co-edited by Gaspar No\u00e9. An international co-production between France and Belgium, the film takes place in 1996 during the winter season, within a single building, and features a large ensemble cast of twenty-four (led by Sofia Boutella) portraying a French dance troupe throwing an after-party after a rehearsal; however, the celebrations take a darker turn when everyone becomes increasingly agitated and confused after consuming sangria laced with LSD.</p><p>The film is notable for its unusual style and production, having been conceived and pre-produced in only four weeks and shot in chronological order in only 15 days: although No\u00e9 conceived the premise, the large majority of the film was unrehearsed on-the-spot improvisation by the cast, who were given no lines of dialogue beforehand and had almost complete liberty as to where to take the story and characters. Climax also features unusual editing and cinematography choices, and includes several lengthy long takes, including one lasting over 42 minutes. The cast of the film consists almost exclusively of dancers who, aside from Boutella and Souheila Yacoub, had no previous acting experience.</p><p>Climax premiered on 10 May 2018 in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Art Cinema Award. It was theatrically released in France on 19 September 2018 by Wild Bunch and in Belgium on 21 November 2018 by O'Brother Distribution. The film received positive reviews, with many critics praising its direction, cinematography, soundtrack, choreography, and performances, although some criticized its violence and perceived lack of story.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>A series of audition tapes is depicted, in which choreographer Selva and DJ Daddy interview potential future members of a dance troupe they are creating. They discuss topics like dance, fears, relationships, sex, and drug experiences. One night during the winter season in 1996, in an abandoned school, the collected dancers rehearse an elaborate routine before starting an after-party. They dance and drink sangria made by the troupe manager, Emmanuelle. The diverse group has several personal issues and share gossip about one another during the celebration.</p><p>As the party progresses, the dancers get increasingly more agitated and confused and eventually come to the conclusion that the sangria has been spiked with LSD. At first they accuse Emmanuelle since she made the drink, but she points out that she drank it and is also suffering from its effects. Taylor, already resentful towards Omar for dating his sister Gazelle, points out that Omar, a non-drinker, has not touched the sangria and accuses him of being the one responsible. The group gets angry and locks him outside the building in freezing conditions.</p><p>Emmanuelle sees her young son, Tito, who is present at the rehearsals, drink the sangria and locks him inside an electrical room to protect him from the agitated dancers. Selva goes to the room of her friend Lou, where Lou confesses that she did not drink because she is pregnant. However, Dom, strongly affected by the drug, enters the room, accuses Lou of spiking the drink and kicks her several times in the stomach; Lou, hurt and in great pain both emotional and physical, passes through an altercation between Alaia and Jennifer, during which Jennifer's hair is set aflame after Alaia gets physically aggressive due to Jennifer's refusal to share her cocaine.</p><p>A frenzied Lou confronts Dom with a knife on the dance floor, but the group, all heavily affected by the LSD at this point, turns on her and accuses her of having spiked the drink. Suffering an emotional breakdown, Lou ends up beating her own stomach and slices herself superficially with the knife on her face and arm after the group encourages her to kill herself. Emmanuelle, who has lost the key to the electric room in which Tito is locked, recklessly tries to free her son. When the school suddenly loses power, she realises that Tito\u2014who is no longer screaming from the other side of the door\u2014has electrocuted himself.</p><p>Ivana brings a heavily hallucinating Selva to Ivana's room where the two take shelter and have sex. David discovers the two and is kicked out. David tries to enter DJ Daddy's room but is also evicted. Rejected, David encounters Gazelle as her brother, Taylor, attempts to have sex with her. Gazelle flees from Taylor and stumbles into the central hall where the remaining dancers have truly lost their minds, dancing, writhing on the floor, chanting in tongues, having sex with one another, or beating each other up. Taylor catches up to Gazelle and takes her to his room while David is attacked by another dancer who slams his head against the floor.</p><p>When police arrive the next morning, they find a majority of the dancers unconscious. Omar has frozen to death outside while Emmanuelle has killed herself outside the electrical room out of grief. Gazelle wakes up next to Taylor, seemingly having forgotten the evening. A bloody Lou exits the building, and writhes outside in snow laughing uncontrollably. As the police search the building, Psych\u00e9, who has several books related to hallucinogens in her bag, and has had an apparent lack of suffering from acid, goes to her room and drops drugs into her eyes.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Sofia Boutella as Selva</li><li>Romain Guillermic as David</li><li>Souheila Yacoub as Lou</li><li>Kiddy Smile as Daddy</li><li>Claude Gajan Maull as Emmanuelle</li><li>Giselle Palmer as Gazelle</li><li>Taylor Kastle as Taylor</li><li>Thea Carla Sch\u00f8tt as Psych\u00e9</li><li>Sharleen Temple as Ivana</li><li>L\u00e9a Vlamos as Eva</li><li>Ala\u00efa Alsafir as Ala\u00efa</li><li>Kendall Mugler as Rocket</li><li>Lakdhar Dridi as Riley</li><li>Adrien Sissoko as Omar</li><li>Mamadou Bathily as Bart</li><li>Alou Sidibe as Kyrra</li><li>Ashley Biscette as Shirley</li><li>Mounia Nassangar as Dom</li><li>Tiphanie Au as Sila</li><li>Sarah Belala as Jennifer</li><li>Alexandre Moreau as Cyborg</li><li>Naab as Rocco</li><li>Strauss Serpent as Serpent</li><li>Vince Galliot Cumant as Tito</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>The film is loosely based on the true story of a French dance troupe in the 1990s who had their alcoholic beverage spiked with LSD at an after-party; however, no further incidents took place during the actual event, unlike in the film. The idea of making a film based around dance came to No\u00e9 in late November/December 2017, when he was invited to a vogue ballroom by L\u00e9a Vlamos (who would eventually be a part of the film's cast): \"I couldn\u2019t believe the energy and the crowd \u2013 and then I thought, I\u2019d love to film these kind of people. I\u2019d also seen that movie by David LaChapelle called Rize, about krumping. I was amazed by these young kids dancing like they were possessed by evil forces.\" Although he originally felt inspired to make a documentary film about dance, he came up with the idea of Climax in early January 2018. He used 1970s films for additional inspiration, including The Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure and Shivers.</p><p>He stated that the film was \"all about people creating something together, and failing in the second half. It\u2019s like the story of the Tower of Babel. Mankind can create big things. And then with the influence of alcohol, or some accident, everything falls. I remember as a teenager when I was 14, I would host parties at my home. And I liked sangria, it was the first alcohol I ever drank. But you seriously don\u2019t need drugs to lose control, alcohol is more than enough. I\u2019ve seen so many more fights linked to alcohol \u2013 it can turn you crazy.\" In another interview, he claimed that the theme of the film was \"a group people creating something together and then collapsing.\" No\u00e9, who had experience using LSD, claimed that the film was more about the impact fear can have on people than it was about drug abuse. He also denied that the film had any kind of moral agenda, pointing out that \"It is not necessarily the most aggressive ones that get punished. It's mostly about a collective screw-up.\"</p><h4>Pre-production</h4><p>In early January 2018, No\u00e9 had the idea of starting the production of Climax right away, and to make the film much faster than in typical productions. Producers Vincent Maraval (who had produced No\u00e9's previous two films Enter the Void and Love) and Edouard Weil agreed, under the condition that No\u00e9 would keep the production very short and film it for cheap. No\u00e9 stated: \"The whole project happened very quickly. We started casting and preparing the movie at the beginning of January, and we were shooting one month later in an abandoned school in a suburb in Paris. It was the most joyful and quick shooting I\u2019ve ever done.\" He was able to quickly find a crew, made up of people that he had worked with before or had wanted to work with for a long time. The crew included cinematographer Beno\u00eet Debie, assistant director Claire Cobetta, and set decorator Jean Rabasse.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>The film was cast over the month of January 2018. It was mostly made of dancers with no acting experience, as No\u00e9 found the cast himself mostly in ballrooms, krumping battles, or on the internet.

Neither is the least bit interesting. Gaspar Noe doesn\u2019t care what you think. He make movies to provoke, if not to inspire annoyance, even hate. When a mom locks her young son in an electrical closet (inside is a menacing circuit panel that, if animate, would swallow the child whole), even those without kids cringe as the boy screams for help. Noe laughs at your discomfort.\" He concluded saying: \"You just have to figure out if it's a ride you want to take\".</p><p>Regarding the overall positive response to Climax, unlike most of his films which were more polarizing or controversial, No\u00e9 stated jokingly: \"I must be doing something wrong. I have to take a long holiday and rethink my career.\" In another he claimed: \"Even my father tell me it's his favorite film, and there's a lot of directors who told me it was my best film. I never worked so little on something and I was never congratulated so much.\"</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"Reference(s)\">Ref(s)</abbr></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>Cannes Film Festival</span></th><td><span>17 May 2018</span></td><td><span>Art Cinema Award</span></td><td><span>Gaspar No\u00e9</span></td><td style=\"background: #99FF99; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2\">Won</td><td style=\"text-align:center;\"></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>Dublin Film Critics Circle Awards</span></th><td><span>20 December 2018</span></td><td>Best Cinematography</td><td><span>Beno\u00eet Debie</span></td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td><td style=\"text-align:center;\"></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>Festival du nouveau cin\u00e9ma</span></th><td>13 October 2018</td><td>Temps \u00d8 Public's Choice Award</td><td><i>Climax</i></td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td><td style=\"text-align:center;\"></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>Lumi\u00e8res Award</span></th><td rowspan=\"2\"><span>4 February 2019</span></td><td><span>Best Director</span></td><td>Gaspar No\u00e9</td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td><td style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td><span>Best Cinematography</span></td><td>Beno\u00eet Debie</td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>Neuch\u00e2tel International Fantastic Film Festival</span></th><td rowspan=\"2\">14 July 2018</td><td>H.
