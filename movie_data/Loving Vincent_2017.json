    "plot": "A year after the death of artist Vincent van Gogh (Robert Gulaczyk), Postman Joseph Roulin Chris O'Dowd) gets his slacker son, Armand (Douglas Booth), to hand deliver the artist's final letter written to his now late brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz), to some worthy recipient after multiple failed postal delivery attempts. Although disdainful of this seemingly pointless chore, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise where a purported close companion to Vincent, Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), lives. Having to wait until the doctor returns from business, Armand meets many of the people of that village who not only knew Vincent, but were apparently also models and inspirations for his art. In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man ...",

The film premiered at the 2017 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. It won Best Animated Feature Film Award at the 30th European Film Awards in Berlin and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 90th Academy Awards.\r\nPlot\r\nOne year after Vincent van Gogh's suicide, postman Joseph Roulin asks his son Armand to deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo. Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.\r\nP\u00e8re Tanguy, a Montmartre art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to Auvers-sur-Oise and look for Dr. Paul Gachet, who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at the same inn that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux, who was fond of Van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.\r\nThroughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named Ren\u00e9 Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, was in possession of a gun, and had often drunkenly waved it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates Ren\u00e9, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that Ren\u00e9 was capable of murder.\r\nDr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them \u2013 Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of deteriorating Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, Johanna, thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of Van Gogh's letters to her \u2013 signed, \"Your loving Vincent.\"\r\nCast\r\nThe leading cast is as follows:\r\nRobert Gulaczyk as Vincent van Gogh Jochum ten Haaf as Vincent van Gogh (voice)\r\nJochum ten Haaf as Vincent van Gogh (voice)\r\nDouglas Booth as Armand Roulin\r\nJerome Flynn as Paul Gachet\r\nSaoirse Ronan as Marguerite Gachet\r\nHelen McCrory as Louise Chevalier\r\nChris O'Dowd as Postman Joseph Roulin\r\nJohn Sessions as P\u00e8re Tanguy\r\nEleanor Tomlinson as Adeline Ravoux\r\nAidan Turner as Boatman\r\nGraham Pavey as Mr Ravoux\r\nJoe Stuckey as Idiot Boy\r\nProduction\r\nThe filmmakers chose classically trained painters over traditional animators because, as Welchman said later, he wanted to avoid artists with \"personalised styles\" and employ people who were \"very pure oil painters\" instead. A total of 125 painters from over 20 countries travelled to Poland to work on the project following selection from around 5,000 applicants, many of whom responded to an online \"recruitment teaser\". The number of participants was greater than originally envisaged, which meant that due to difficulties in obtaining funding the task had to be completed in a correspondingly shorter period of time.\r\nCreation of the film storyboard was informed by Van Gogh's paintings, sometimes with only minor alterations to the latter, but on occasions more complex transformations involving changes to the weather or time of day were carried out. Since artists typically painted over frames once they had been photographed, of the 65,000 produced during the course of the project only 1,000 survived.\r\nThe film uses a form of rotoscoping. Production for the film began with a live-action cast filming against a green screen. After filming, editors composited Van Gogh paintings into scene backgrounds, and finally cut the movie together as usual. However, once the actual film was complete, they shot each individual frame onto a blank canvas, and artists painted over each image. In all the project took 6 years to complete, and in describing the laborious process involved Welchman noted that the movie's creators had \"definitely without a doubt invented the slowest form of filmmaking ever devised in 120 years.\"\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe movie is considered a box office success, grossing over an estimated $42.1 million (in USD) worldwide on a budget of $5.5 million, with United States earnings totaling $6.7 million. The film has most notably grossed $3 million in South Korea, $2.1 million in Italy and $10.8 million in China.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Loving Vincent's dazzling visual achievements make this Van Gogh biopic well worth seeking out \u2013 even if its narrative is far less effectively composed.\" Metacritic reports a score of 62 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nA. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, found the visual aspects of the film to be innovative stating: \"the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film's innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade. But its charm never quite wears off, for reasons summed up in the title.\" Actress Angourie Rice had similar sentiments, writing in an essay that \u201cit was such a fascinating experience to witness the actors\u2019 performances turned into Van Gogh style paintings. The great thing about this film is that it also made me question what the merging of artforms meant for art, film, and everything in between.\u201d\r\nGiuseppe Sedia of the Krakow Post praised the impressive visual style of the movie. However, he added, \"In their concern to keep the viewers interested, directors Kobiela and Welchman have built an over-narrated and spirit-dampening movie in which the preponderance of the dialogues hinders the viewers\u2019 immersion into the violent beauty and materiality of Van Gogh\u2019s oeuvre\".\r\nAwards and accolades\r\nThe film won the \"Most Popular International Feature\" award at the 2017 Vancouver International Film Festival. It was nominated in the Hollywood Music in Media Awards 2017 for Best Original Score in an Animated Film. It won the Audience Award at the 2017 Annecy International Animated Film Festival and the Golden Goblet for Best Animation Film at the Shanghai International Film Festival. It won the XII Festival de Cine In\u00e9dito de M\u00e9rida (FCIM) after obtaining the highest score among the projected films and also the highest score obtained in the history of the event.

The man was carrying nothing; his hands clasped to a fresh bullet wound leaking blood from his belly. This was Vincent van Gogh, then a little known artist; now the most famous artist in the world. His tragic death has long been known, what has remained a mystery is how and why he came to be shot. 'Loving Vincent' tells that story.",
