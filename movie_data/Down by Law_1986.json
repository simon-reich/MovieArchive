Both Zack (Waits), a disc jockey, and Jack (Lurie), a pimp, have been set up, neither having committed the crime for which they have been arrested. Their cellmate Bob (Benigni, in his first international role), an Italian tourist who understands minimal English, was imprisoned for accidental manslaughter.\r\nZack and Jack soon come to blows and thereafter avoid speaking to each other. Bob has an irrepressible need for conversation. He hatches a plan to escape, and before long the three are on the run through the swamp surrounding the prison. Hopelessly lost and with a simmering hatred between Jack and Zack almost causing the party to split up, they are brought together by Bob's ability to provide food. The trio eventually chances across a house in the forest, the residence of Nicoletta (Braschi). Bob and Nicoletta instantly fall in love, and Bob decides to stay with her in the forest. Zack and Jack go their separate ways\u2014an unspoken, begrudging friendship hanging between them as they part.\r\nCast\r\nTom Waits as Zack\r\nJohn Lurie as Jack\r\nRoberto Benigni as Roberto\r\nNicoletta Braschi as Nicoletta\r\nEllen Barkin as Laurette\r\nBillie Neal as Bobbie\r\nRockets Redglare as Gig\r\nVernel Bagneris as Preston\r\nTimothea as Julie\r\nL.C.

            "html": "<h2>Down by Law (film)</h2><p>Down by Law is a 1986 black-and-white independent film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch and starring Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni.</p><p>The film centers on the arrest, incarceration, and escape from jail of three men. It discards jailbreak film conventions by focusing on the interaction between the convicts rather than on the mechanics of the escape. A key element in the film is Robby M\u00fcller's slow-moving camerawork, which captures the architecture of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou to which the cellmates escape.</p><br/><h3>Plot summary</h3><p>Three men, previously unknown to each other, are arrested in New Orleans and placed in the same cell. Both Zack (Waits), a disc jockey, and Jack (Lurie), a pimp, have been set up, neither having committed the crime for which they have been arrested. Their cellmate Bob (Benigni, in his first international role), an Italian tourist who understands minimal English, was imprisoned for accidental manslaughter.</p><p>Zack and Jack soon come to blows and thereafter avoid speaking to each other. Bob has an irrepressible need for conversation. He hatches a plan to escape, and before long the three are on the run through the swamp surrounding the prison. Hopelessly lost and with a simmering hatred between Jack and Zack almost causing the party to split up, they are brought together by Bob's ability to provide food. The trio eventually chances across a house in the forest, the residence of Nicoletta (Braschi). Bob and Nicoletta instantly fall in love, and Bob decides to stay with her in the forest. Zack and Jack go their separate ways\u2014an unspoken, begrudging friendship hanging between them as they part.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Tom Waits as Zack</li><li>John Lurie as Jack</li><li>Roberto Benigni as Roberto</li><li>Nicoletta Braschi as Nicoletta</li><li>Ellen Barkin as Laurette</li><li>Billie Neal as Bobbie</li><li>Rockets Redglare as Gig</li><li>Vernel Bagneris as Preston</li><li>Timothea as Julie</li><li>L.C.
