Tagged as \"The first Iranian vampire Western\", it was chosen to show in the \"Next\" program at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.\r\nThe film is described as being set in \"the Iranian ghost-town Bad City\" and depicts the doings of \"a lonesome vampire\".\r\nPlot\r\nA young, hardworking Iranian man named Arash lives with and takes care of his heroin-addicted father, Hossein. They are harassed by a cruel, drug-dealer pimp named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\r\nSaeed comes across a strange young woman in a chador at night. She seduces Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long fangs and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his car keys along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a costume party at a night club dressed up as Dracula, where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the ecstasy pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.\r\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, skateboarding, or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a safety pin, but she eventually leaves.\r\nAtti, a prostitute who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\r\nSuffering from heroin withdrawal, Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.\r\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.\r\nCast\r\nSheila Vand as The Girl\r\nArash Marandi as Arash\r\nMarshall Manesh as Hossein\r\nDominic Rains as Saeed\r\nMozhan Marn\u00f2 as Atti\r\nRome Shadanloo as Shaydah\r\nMasuka as the cat\r\nThemes\r\nThe director, regarding the mythology of the vampire, has stated that: \"A vampire is so many things: serial killer, a romantic, a historian, a drug addict \u2013 they're sort of all these things in one.\"The film examines these facets of a vampire as described by Amirpour in a variety of ways.\r\nThe film's protagonist, The Girl, is a sort-of antihero vigilante with a taste for bad men. As a vampire, she is able to roam the streets at night without being concerned for her safety, subverting the implications of the film's title. She is the perpetrator, not the victim, and possesses agency and power that would not be typically reserved for her in an environment such as Bad City. In this way, the film has feminist leanings.\r\nRockabilly, a gender-bending, minor background character who exists on the fringe of Bad City throughout the duration of the movie, acts as a silent observer to the events around them. Director Amirpour states that \"If there's one political thing, it's not the chador, it's Rockabilly, because it's not OK to be gay in Iran.\"\r\nProduction\r\nAn early short film with the same title from Amirpour screened at festivals and won Best Short Film at the Noor Iranian Film Festival.\r\nAn Indiegogo campaign was launched in July 2012 to fund the feature-length version of the film. On August 27, 2012, the campaign's goal of $55,000 was surpassed. The project ended up with a total sum of $56,903 raised by 290 backers.\r\nThe film was shot over the course of twenty-four days, in the town of Taft in Kern County in southern California.\r\nThe film premiered at Sundance in 2014.\r\nIn an interview with MovieMaker, Amirpour spoke regarding her relationship with filmmaking:\r\n\u201cPeople ask me, \u201cWhy did you make A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night?\u201d My answer is that I was lonely\u2014that\u2019s why. But taking that a step further, the truth is that I make films to make friends and find real intimacy; a connection with others based on something that\u2019s meaningful to me. The people who make these films with you, your cast and crew\u2014it\u2019s like they\u2019re on a vision quest with you. That is an incomparable experience. And then when the film is done and out there, the people who are attracted to your film\u2014the audiences, festivals that embrace it, other filmmakers, artists, the critics who like what you do\u2014those are my friends. And I don\u2019t expect to be friends with everyone.\u201d\r\nAmirpour is a lifelong skater, and was a stand-in for the skateboarding sequences present in the film.\r\nStyle\r\nThe film is directed and imagined by Ana Lily Amirpour with cinematography by Lyle Vincent. Its style is clearly inspired by spaghetti westerns like those of Sergio Leone, featuring a mysterious, lone, antihero with a vigilante streak. However, the genre is reimagined with a female lead, and is a hybrid spaghetti western-vampire film. As a vampire film it serves as an homage to its legacy of predecessors especially the 1922 German Expressionist film Nosferatu. Echoes of the film are seen in the choice of black and white, the use of shadows, and the minimal dialogue.

Tagged as \"The first Iranian vampire Western\", it was chosen to show in the \"Next\" program at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.</p><p>The film is described as being set in \"the Iranian ghost-town Bad City\" and depicts the doings of \"a lonesome vampire\".</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>A young, hardworking Iranian man named Arash lives with and takes care of his heroin-addicted father, Hossein. They are harassed by a cruel, drug-dealer pimp named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.</p><p>Saeed comes across a strange young woman in a chador at night. She seduces Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long fangs and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his car keys along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a costume party at a night club dressed up as Dracula, where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the ecstasy pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.</p><p>The woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, skateboarding, or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a safety pin, but she eventually leaves.</p><p>Atti, a prostitute who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.</p><p>Suffering from heroin withdrawal, Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.</p><p>The following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Sheila Vand as The Girl</li><li>Arash Marandi as Arash</li><li>Marshall Manesh as Hossein</li><li>Dominic Rains as Saeed</li><li>Mozhan Marn\u00f2 as Atti</li><li>Rome Shadanloo as Shaydah</li><li>Masuka as the cat</li></ul><br/><h3>Themes</h3><p>The director, regarding the mythology of the vampire, has stated that: \"A vampire is so many things: serial killer, a romantic, a historian, a drug addict \u2013 they're sort of all these things in one.\"The film examines these facets of a vampire as described by Amirpour in a variety of ways.</p><p>The film's protagonist, The Girl, is a sort-of antihero vigilante with a taste for bad men. As a vampire, she is able to roam the streets at night without being concerned for her safety, subverting the implications of the film's title. She is the perpetrator, not the victim, and possesses agency and power that would not be typically reserved for her in an environment such as Bad City. In this way, the film has feminist leanings.</p><p>Rockabilly, a gender-bending, minor background character who exists on the fringe of Bad City throughout the duration of the movie, acts as a silent observer to the events around them. Director Amirpour states that \"If there's one political thing, it's not the chador, it's Rockabilly, because it's not OK to be gay in Iran.\"</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>An early short film with the same title from Amirpour screened at festivals and won Best Short Film at the Noor Iranian Film Festival.</p><p>An Indiegogo campaign was launched in July 2012 to fund the feature-length version of the film. On August 27, 2012, the campaign's goal of $55,000 was surpassed. The project ended up with a total sum of $56,903 raised by 290 backers.</p><p>The film was shot over the course of twenty-four days, in the town of Taft in Kern County in southern California.</p><p>The film premiered at Sundance in 2014.</p><p>In an interview with MovieMaker, Amirpour spoke regarding her relationship with filmmaking:</p><blockquote>\u201cPeople ask me, \u201cWhy did you make A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night?\u201d My answer is that I was lonely\u2014that\u2019s why. But taking that a step further, the truth is that I make films to make friends and find real intimacy; a connection with others based on something that\u2019s meaningful to me. The people who make these films with you, your cast and crew\u2014it\u2019s like they\u2019re on a vision quest with you. That is an incomparable experience. And then when the film is done and out there, the people who are attracted to your film\u2014the audiences, festivals that embrace it, other filmmakers, artists, the critics who like what you do\u2014those are my friends. And I don\u2019t expect to be friends with everyone.\u201d</blockquote><p>Amirpour is a lifelong skater, and was a stand-in for the skateboarding sequences present in the film.</p><br/><h3>Style</h3><p>The film is directed and imagined by Ana Lily Amirpour with cinematography by Lyle Vincent. Its style is clearly inspired by spaghetti westerns like those of Sergio Leone, featuring a mysterious, lone, antihero with a vigilante streak. However, the genre is reimagined with a female lead, and is a hybrid spaghetti western-vampire film. As a vampire film it serves as an homage to its legacy of predecessors especially the 1922 German Expressionist film Nosferatu. Echoes of the film are seen in the choice of black and white, the use of shadows, and the minimal dialogue. The film's dialogue is entirely in Farsi, and the film blends elements of Iranian culture with the spaghetti western-vampire imagery described above.</p><p>The film was shot digitally with anamorphic lenses, which Amirpour and Vincent selected in an effort to emphasize the bleak, otherworldly atmosphere of the film.</p><p>Amirpour has stated that graphic novels are a major source of inspiration for her. The visual language of the film is not unlike that of a comic book, with its \u201chigh-contrast monochrome aesthetic\u201d. Additionally, Bad City, the fictional location in which the film is set, may perhaps be a nod to Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cSin City\u201d.</p><p>Amirpour has said that she had her actors watch Nosferatu and many spaghetti westerns in preparation for their roles.</p><p>She has also said that \"every piece of the story, every character, every costume, every bit of music\" is something that she \"love to the point of obsession.\"</p><br/><h3>Soundtrack</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th class=\"tlheader\" scope=\"col\"
