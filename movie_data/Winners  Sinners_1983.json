However, the character names and indeed their roles differ - Stanley Fung's character is the nominal \"leader\" of the quintet in Winners and Sinners, whereas Hung's character takes the mantle in the latter films.\r\nPlot\r\nFive prisoners - Teapot (Sammo Hung), Curly (John Sham), Exhaust Pipe (Richard Ng), Vaseline (Charlie Chin), and Rookie (Stanley Fung) meet in their cell to form a friendship. Rookie assumes the leadership of the group, whilst Teapot is bullied by the others (in the later films, Roundhead, played by Eric Tsang, is the group's victim and Hung's character is the leader). Following their release, they team up with Curly's beautiful sister, Shirley (Cherie Chung), and form a company called the Five Stars Cleaning Co. While most of the group attempt to vie for Shirley's affection, Teapot ultimately forms a relationship with her.\r\nA sixth convict, the wealthy Jack Tar (James Tien), is released on the same day. Upon his release, he commences work on his next criminal project: trading counterfeit US and Hong Kong currency with an American crime boss. Jack sends his chauffeur to do the exchange at a skating competition, but the chauffeur's insecure attitude attracts the attention of two muggers. The muggers steal the briefcase containing the counterfeit US money and take off. Police officer CID 07 (Jackie Chan) attempts to recover the briefcase containing the phony money, but the case accidentally ends up in the Five Stars Cleaning Co. van. CID 07 continues his pursuit of the muggers, which results in a massive freeway pile-up.\r\nTeapot and his friends are unaware of the mishap, and drive away with the case. The chauffeur informs Jack, who orders his men to search for them. Later, Jack hosts a party at his mansion. Teapot and his friends decide to gatecrash, hoping to expand their business with the wealthy guests. They successfully enter the mansion undetected, and while socializing with the other guests, Jack privately meets a Triad boss to discuss a new deal for the counterfeit plates. A bodyguard then realizes the Five Stars Cleaning Co. are there, and alerts Jack, who interrogates Curly. Curly insists he has no knowledge about the case, and the ensuing ruckus causes a physical confrontation between the friends and Jack's bodyguards. The friends narrowly escape, only to be kidnapped by the Triad boss, who secretly wants to cut off the deal with Jack and obtain the plates himself. He orders the friends to give up the case, and holds Shirley hostage. The friends return home and finally discover the case. When they leave to make the dropoff, however, Jack's men arrives. Teapot, Exhaust Pipe, and Vaseline engage them in battle, while Curly leaves to fetch the Triad boss and Rookie goes for help. The Triad boss and his bodyguards arrive, where Jack learns of his motives and turns the fight against him instead. The police arrive, led by Rookie, who reveals himself to be undercover. They arrest Jack and the Triad boss and their men and rewards the friends for their assistance.\r\nCast\r\nSammo Hung as Teapot\r\nJohn Shum as Curly / Jack So\r\nRichard Ng as Exhaust Pipe / Wind Pipe\r\nCharlie Chin as Vaseline\r\nStanley Fung as Rookie / Ranks\r\nCherie Chung as Shirley\r\nJackie Chan as CID 07 / Cop #7086\r\nCecilia Yip as Ceci (CID 07's Girlfriend)\r\nYuen Biao as CID Agent\r\nMoon Lee as CID Agent\u2019s Girlfriend\r\nPhilip Chan as Inspector\r\nJames Tien as Jack Tar\r\nMars as Robber\r\nTai Bo as Chai\r\nFung Hak-on as Pat\r\nFung Ging-man as Angry Fisherman\r\nPaul Chang as Inspector\r\nDick Wei as Henchman\r\nWu Ma as Postman\r\nChiu Chi-ling as Master Chiu\r\nProduction\r\nSammo Hung got the idea for the film from an old TV show, in which a group of police officers from different backgrounds worked together, each displaying their own particular skills.
