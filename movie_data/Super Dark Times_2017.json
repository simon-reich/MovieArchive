Later that week, the four boys meet up at Josh's house where they look through the possessions of Josh's brother, who is in the marines. They find a bag of marijuana, a pair of nunchaku, and a katana.\r\nAfterwards the boys slash milk cartons with the katana in a nearby forest. The boys notice that Daryl is smoking a joint and has stolen the marijuana. After a tense argument, Daryl hits Josh. The two fight, resulting in Daryl being accidentally stabbed in the throat with the katana. The boys panic and decide to hide both Daryl's body and the katana.\r\nDuring the next two days of school, rumors circulate about Daryl's disappearance. Zach has nightmares and Josh doesn\u2019t attend classes. Zach wants to return to Daryl's burial site and attend Allison's upcoming party with Josh.

A neighbor intervenes, separates them, and holds Josh down.\r\nPolice and paramedics arrive at the scene. While the paramedics attend to Zach's wounds, he glances at Josh sitting in the back of a police car.\r\nMonths later, Allison has recovered and returns to school. A camera shot from the back of the classroom reveals the scars she received from the katana: three parallel lines on the back of her neck.\r\nCast\r\nOwen Campbell as Zach Taylor\r\nCharlie Tahan as Josh Templeton\r\nElizabeth Cappuccino as Allison Bannister\r\nMax Talisman as Daryl Harper\r\nSawyer Barth as Charlie Barth\r\nAmy Hargreaves as Karen Taylor\r\nAdea Lennox as Meghan\r\nEthan Botwick as John Whitcomb\r\nAnni Krueger as Mrs. Barron\r\nKortnee Simmons as Eugene\r\nRelease\r\nThe film premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival.
