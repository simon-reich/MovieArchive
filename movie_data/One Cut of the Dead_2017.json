The director, Higurashi, argues with actors and eventually abandons them. A real zombie apocalypse then begins to the delight of Higurashi, who insists that the camera operator continue filming.\r\nCast\r\nTakayuki Hamatsu as Takayuki Higurashi\r\nMao as Mao Higurashi\r\nHarumi Shuhama as Harumi Higurashi\r\nYuzuki Akiyama as Aika Matsumoto\r\nKazuaki Nagaya as Kazuaki Kamiya\r\nManabu Hosoi as Manabu Hosoda\r\nProduction\r\nOne Cut of the Dead was made for \u00a53 million (approximately $25,000 at the time) with a cast of unknown actors. It was made in eight days after director Shinichiro Ueda participated in workshops for actors and filmmakers at the Enbu Seminar drama school in Tokyo.\r\nRelease\r\nOne Cut of the Dead opened in Japan in an 84-seat Tokyo art house theater with an initial theatrical run of six days. The film began garnering international attention after it became the runner-up in the audience vote at the Udine Far East Festival. Of the films screening at Udine, it received a standing ovation and the Audience Award at the Udine Far East Film Festival in year 2018.\r\nAfter receiving positive reviews outside of Japan, the film was released in three cinemas in Tokyo in June with discounts for an audience in zombie costumes to help the film gain attention. Asmik Ace stepped in to co-distribute the film, giving it a wider release in July. It was showing at around 200 screens in Japan by March 2018 where it had officially grossed \u00a5800 million.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nIn Japan, the film sold 2,149,449 tickets and grossed \u00a53,040,246,069 in 136 days. It became the seventh highest-grossing domestic film of 2018, grossing \u00a53.12 billion ($28.3 million) at the Japanese box office.
