His girlfriend Riley Seabrook studies in a university and he is estranged of his stepfather. Sean and Derek are also smalltime burglars, stealing the houses of the costumers while they are eating in the restaurant. One day, the obnoxious client Cale Erendreich arrives at the restaurant driving a Maserati and Sean drives his car back to his house using the computer and Derek watches Cale in the restaurant. While snooping around the house, Sean finds a locked room and when he opens the door, he stumbles upon a woman tied to a chair with chains and gagged. He unsuccessfully tries to release her but he is forced to return to the restaurant with the Maserati. Sean decides to call the police, but Cale lures the police officers and turns Sean's life upside-down.",

Sheehan portrays the title character, a valet who burglarizes the houses of the drivers he services, only to discover one of his rich customers (Tennant) is a serial killer. It was released in the United States on May 4, 2018, and received mixed reviews from critics.\r\nPlot\r\nWhile working as valets at a restaurant, Sean Falco and Derek Sandoval secretly use the cars entrusted to them by customers to burglarize their homes. On one night, however, Sean finds more than he bargained for when he breaks into the house of wealthy patron Cale Erendreich and discovers a woman named Katie being held captive. Unable to free Katie, Sean abandons her, but notifies the police of his discovery. When the police are unable to find any evidence of Katie's abduction, Sean contacts the FBI and files a missing persons report for her.\r\nCale, meanwhile, brings Katie to a secluded cabin and becomes aware of Sean's knowledge of her abduction. Motivated by a desire to break people down, Cale begins working to destroy Sean's life, including having Sean, Derek, and Sean's parents fired from their jobs. He also savagely beats Riley Seabrook, Sean's girlfriend, after ruining their relationship by leaking a topless photo of her. Cale then kills Derek and his family in their home and stages their deaths as a murder-suicide, although Sean is able to get a picture of Cale, which he sends to the FBI.\r\nUsing the GPS in Cale's car, Sean is able to find the cabin where Katie is being held captive and heads off to save her after surviving Cale's attempt to kill him with a bomb. A team of FBI agents also travel to the cabin after deducing that Cale is responsible for a series of disappearances and that the property is in the name of Cale's family, but are unable to enter the private property without a warrant. Sean finds Katie, only to be knocked out by Cale, who reveals that he intends to kill Katie and frame Sean for her murder, along with the deaths of his previous victims. Katie, however, survives Cale's attempt at killing her and frees Sean, with Cale in pursuit.\r\nChasing Sean and Katie through the woods, Cale is ultimately overpowered by Sean and knocked unconscious. The sound of Cale's gun is also heard by the FBI team, who are able to use the gunshot's noise as probable cause to enter the property. After finding Sean and Katie, the team enters the cabin, where they discover Cale chained up like his victims.\r\nCast\r\nDavid Tennant as Cale Erendreich, a wealthy serial killer\r\nRobert Sheehan as Sean Falco, a restaurant valet and house burglar\r\nKerry Condon as Katie Hopgood, a woman held captive in Cale's home\r\nCarlito Olivero as Derek Sandoval, Sean's fellow valet and partner in the burglaries\r\nJacqueline Byers as Riley Seabrook, Sean's girlfriend\r\nTracey Heggins as Olivia Fuller, an FBI agent investigating a series of disappearances\r\nRob Nagle as Don Falco, Sean's stepfather\r\nLorraine Bahr as Patty Falco, Sean's mother\r\nJacob Resnikoff as Rowan Falco, Sean's brother\r\nDavid Meyers as Nino, Sean's and Derek's boss\r\nTony Doupe as Wayne Bannon, a detective who initially investigates Cale\r\nLisa Brenner as Helen Leyton\r\nProduction\r\nOn September 16, 2013, it was announced that Dean Devlin's Electric Entertainment had bought the thriller script No Good Deed, written by Brandon Boyce, which Marc Roskin would make his directorial debut on, and which was set to be produced by Devlin, Roskin, and Rachel Olschan. On August 25, 2016, it was reported that Devlin would direct the film instead, and that David Tennant had been cast as a man whose home is burgled by the car valets. On September 22, 2016, Robert Sheehan was cast to star, as one of the valets, and on November 29, 2016, Carlito Olivero joined to play the other valet. Later, more cast was announced, including Kerry Condon, Jacqueline Byers, and Lisa Brenner.\r\nPrincipal photography on the film began early 2017 in Portland, Oregon.\r\nElectric Entertainment released the first official trailer for the film on February 7, 2018.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nIn the United States and Canada, Bad Samaritan was released alongside Tully and Overboard, and was projected to gross around $2 million from 2,007 theaters in its opening weekend.

            "html": "<h2>Bad Samaritan (film)</h2><p>Bad Samaritan is a 2018 American horror-thriller film directed by Dean Devlin and written by Brandon Boyce. The film stars David Tennant and Robert Sheehan, with Carlito Olivero, Kerry Condon, and Jacqueline Byers in supporting roles. Sheehan portrays the title character, a valet who burglarizes the houses of the drivers he services, only to discover one of his rich customers (Tennant) is a serial killer. It was released in the United States on May 4, 2018, and received mixed reviews from critics.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>While working as valets at a restaurant, Sean Falco and Derek Sandoval secretly use the cars entrusted to them by customers to burglarize their homes. On one night, however, Sean finds more than he bargained for when he breaks into the house of wealthy patron Cale Erendreich and discovers a woman named Katie being held captive. Unable to free Katie, Sean abandons her, but notifies the police of his discovery. When the police are unable to find any evidence of Katie's abduction, Sean contacts the FBI and files a missing persons report for her.</p><p>Cale, meanwhile, brings Katie to a secluded cabin and becomes aware of Sean's knowledge of her abduction. Motivated by a desire to break people down, Cale begins working to destroy Sean's life, including having Sean, Derek, and Sean's parents fired from their jobs. He also savagely beats Riley Seabrook, Sean's girlfriend, after ruining their relationship by leaking a topless photo of her. Cale then kills Derek and his family in their home and stages their deaths as a murder-suicide, although Sean is able to get a picture of Cale, which he sends to the FBI.</p><p>Using the GPS in Cale's car, Sean is able to find the cabin where Katie is being held captive and heads off to save her after surviving Cale's attempt to kill him with a bomb. A team of FBI agents also travel to the cabin after deducing that Cale is responsible for a series of disappearances and that the property is in the name of Cale's family, but are unable to enter the private property without a warrant. Sean finds Katie, only to be knocked out by Cale, who reveals that he intends to kill Katie and frame Sean for her murder, along with the deaths of his previous victims. Katie, however, survives Cale's attempt at killing her and frees Sean, with Cale in pursuit.</p><p>Chasing Sean and Katie through the woods, Cale is ultimately overpowered by Sean and knocked unconscious. The sound of Cale's gun is also heard by the FBI team, who are able to use the gunshot's noise as probable cause to enter the property. After finding Sean and Katie, the team enters the cabin, where they discover Cale chained up like his victims.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>David Tennant as Cale Erendreich, a wealthy serial killer</li><li>Robert Sheehan as Sean Falco, a restaurant valet and house burglar</li><li>Kerry Condon as Katie Hopgood, a woman held captive in Cale's home</li><li>Carlito Olivero as Derek Sandoval, Sean's fellow valet and partner in the burglaries</li><li>Jacqueline Byers as Riley Seabrook, Sean's girlfriend</li><li>Tracey Heggins as Olivia Fuller, an FBI agent investigating a series of disappearances</li><li>Rob Nagle as Don Falco, Sean's stepfather</li><li>Lorraine Bahr as Patty Falco, Sean's mother</li><li>Jacob Resnikoff as Rowan Falco, Sean's brother</li><li>David Meyers as Nino, Sean's and Derek's boss</li><li>Tony Doupe as Wayne Bannon, a detective who initially investigates Cale</li><li>Lisa Brenner as Helen Leyton</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>On September 16, 2013, it was announced that Dean Devlin's Electric Entertainment had bought the thriller script No Good Deed, written by Brandon Boyce, which Marc Roskin would make his directorial debut on, and which was set to be produced by Devlin, Roskin, and Rachel Olschan.
