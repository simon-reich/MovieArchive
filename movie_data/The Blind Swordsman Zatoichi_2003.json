            "plainText": "Zat\u014dichi (2003 film)\r\nZatoichi (\u5ea7\u982d\u5e02, Zat\u014dichi) (released in the US as The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi) is a 2003 Japanese samurai drama/action film, directed, written, co-edited by and starring Takeshi Kitano (\"Beat\" Takeshi) in his 11th directorial venture. Kitano plays the role of the blind swordsman.\r\nThe film is a revival of the classic Zatoichi series of samurai film and television dramas. It premiered on 2 September 2003 at the Venice International Film Festival, where it won the prestigious Silver Lion for Best Director award, and went on to numerous other awards both at home and abroad. It also stars Tadanobu Asano, Michiyo Okusu, Yui Natsukawa, Guadalcanal Taka, Daigoro Tachibana, Yuko Daike, Ittoku Kishibe, Saburo Ishikura and Akira Emoto.\r\nPlot\r\nThe film's plot follows a traditional theme, with Zatoichi (a blind swordsman) coming to the defense of townspeople caught up in a local yakuza gang war and being forced to pay excessive amounts of protection money. Meanwhile, Zatoichi befriends a local farmer and her gambler nephew and eventually offers his assistance to two geisha siblings (one of whom is actually a man) who are seeking revenge for the murder of their parents. The siblings are the only survivors of a robbery and massacre that was carried out on their family estate ten years ago. They soon discover the people responsible for the murders are the same yakuza wreaking havoc on the small town.\r\nAfter slicing his way through an army of henchmen with his sword, Zatoichi defeats the yakuza's bodyguard, a powerful r\u014dnin, in a duel. Zatoichi later wanders into town and confronts the yakuza bosses, killing the second-in-command and blinding the elderly yakuza boss (who had been masquerading as a bumbling old waiter up until this point) after surprising him by opening his eyes. The film ends with a dance number led by noted Japanese tap dance troupe The Stripes, and Zatoichi walking down a trail and tripping over a rock, saying \"Even with my eyes wide open, I can't see anything.\"\r\nCast\r\nTakeshi Kitano as Zatoichi\r\nTadanobu Asano as the r\u014dnin Hattori Gennosuke\r\nMichiyo Okusu as Aunt O-ume, the farmer\r\nYui Natsukawa as O-shino, Hattori's wife\r\nDaigoro Tachibana as O-sei\r\nTaichi Saotome as young O-sei\r\nY\u016bko Daike as O-kinu, sister of Osei.\r\nGuadalcanal Taka as Shinkichi, gambler nephew of Oume.\r\nIttoku Kishibe as Ginzo, gang leader\r\nSaburo Ishikura as Ogiya, gang leader\r\nAkira Emoto as \"Pops\", tavern owner\r\nProduction\r\nKitano revealed that he was approached by others to create the film and therefore differed from his own techniques and followed the common filmmaking process in order to please them and make a pure-entertainment film.\r\nThis film marks Kitano's first collaboration with composer Keiichi Suzuki, ending an 11-year streak with Joe Hisaishi. The director said he made the decision feeling that the film needed percussion-based music and that Hisaishi is not a flexible composer, and also suggested that Hisaishi had become too expensive for him. Costumes were created by Kazuko Kurosawa.\r\nReception\r\nThe film grossed US$23.8 million in Japan. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave Zatoichi 4 out of 5 stars. Jasper Sharp of Midnight Eye praised the films as \"pure cinematic magic\".
