They live in isolation, only entering town occasionally for food and supplies. Will makes their money by selling his VA-issued painkillers to other veterans.\r\nAfter Tom is spotted in the woods by a jogger, she and Will are arrested and placed in social services. They are given food and a house on a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon. Will begrudgingly begins work packaging trees, but is bothered by the helicopters used to move them. Tom connects with a boy who is building his own tiny house, and he introduces her to his 4H club.\r\nOne morning Will decides to leave. Tom follows reluctantly. They return to their camp in the park, but find it has been destroyed. Will and Tom catch a ride with a trucker who takes them to Washington and drops them off in a remote area. Cold and darkness force them to build a makeshift tent for the evening. However, the next day they discover a vacant cabin and move in.\r\nWill leaves to find food but does not return. The next morning, Tom discovers him unconscious at the bottom of a hill. She gets help from locals, who take them to their mobile home community. Tom refuses to let Will be taken to a hospital. A local woman calls a friend, a former Army medic and fellow PTSD sufferer, who treats Will's leg and lends him his service dog.\r\nWill and Tom stay in the community while Will\u2019s injuries heal. Tom likes their new home, but eventually Will insists they leave. Tom protests, telling him \"the same thing that\u2019s wrong with you isn't wrong with me\". They tearfully hug and part ways. Tom returns to the community, and Will returns to the woods.\r\nCast\r\nBen Foster as Will, Tom\u2019s father\r\nThomasin McKenzie as Tom, Will\u2019s daughter\r\nJeff Kober as Mr. Walters, a tree farm owner\r\nDale Dickey as Dale, the leader of the RV park\r\nDana Millican as Jean Bauer, Tom\u2019s social worker\r\nMichael Prosser as James, Will's social worker\r\nDerek John Drescher as Larry, a man with whom Will exchanges medications for money\r\nIsaiah Stone as Isaiah, a person whom Tom befriends\r\nProduction\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography took place during the spring of 2017 in Portland, Oregon.
