It was positively received by critics and grossed over $19 million worldwide.\r\nPlot\r\nA highly contagious outbreak ravages the planet. Paul, his wife Sarah, and their teenage son Travis are secluded in their home deep in the woods in an undisclosed location. After Sarah's father, Bud, contracts the disease, they kill him, and burn his body in a shallow grave. The next night, they capture an intruder breaking into the house. Paul ties him to a tree, and places a bag over his head overnight to confirm he is not suffering from the disease. The stranger, Will, explains he did not know the house was occupied, and was searching for fresh water for his wife and his young son. Will offers to trade some of their food for water. Sarah suggests bringing the strangers to their home, reasoning the more people, the easier it would be to defend themselves. Paul reluctantly agrees, and drives Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them, while accusing Will of setting him up. Will explains he fought them, and assuages Paul's mistrust.\r\nPaul returns with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing the rules Paul and Sarah use to stay safe, including a) keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, and b) keeping nighttime excursions to a minimum, the two families establish a sense of normality, and grow closer. One day, Travis's dog Stanley is barking aggressively at and chases an unseen presence in the woods. Travis follows the dog into the woods before Stanley's barking suddenly ceases. Travis insists to Paul and Will he heard something in the woods. They return home after Paul assures Travis that Stanley knows the woods and will find his way home. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he told Paul earlier about his and Kim's activities prior to finding the abandoned house. Paul's response suggests an increasing distrust of Will.\r\nThat evening, Travis discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room suffering from a nightmare. Travis leads him back to his parents' room before hearing a sound from downstairs. Travis finds the front door of the house is slightly-open, and he hears noises. He wakes Paul and Will. They investigate, finding a bleeding and gravely-sick Stanley on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. After Travis reveals the door was open before he came downstairs, Sarah suggests sleepwalking Andrew opened the door. Kim argues the possibility as tensions rise. Paul suspects Andrew is infected, and decides they should quarantine in their separate rooms for a couple days so they can calm down and ensure no one is sick. That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather.\r\nThe next morning, Travis overhears Andrew coughing constantly. A distraught Kim tells Will they need to leave. Travis informs his parents Andrew might be infected, and, as such, he too may be infected. Paul and Sarah don protective masks and gloves, and take weapons to confront Kim and Will. After Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive. Will insists his family is healthy, repeatedly tells Andrew to keep his eyes shut and orders Paul to remove the mask. Will demands Paul give him \"...a fair share...\" of food and water so they can leave. Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will, and force him and his family outside. Will attacks Paul, and tries to beat him to death as Sarah shoots Will in the back. He dies from his wound. Kim flees into the woods with Andrew. Paul fires at them, killing Andrew. Kim hysterically begs Paul to kill her to end her misery, and he does by shooting her.\r\nLater, Travis awakens in bed, visibly sick. His mother comforts him as he dies. Paul and Sarah, now visibly infected, sit at the dinner table in silence.

            "html": "<h2>It Comes at Night</h2><p>It Comes at Night is a 2017 American horror film written and directed by Trey Edward Shults. It stars Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo, Kelvin Harrison Jr., and Riley Keough.</p><p>The film had its premiere at the Overlook Film Festival at Timberline Lodge in Oregon on April 29, 2017, and was theatrically released on June 9, 2017 in the United States, by A24. It was positively received by critics and grossed over $19 million worldwide.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>A highly contagious outbreak ravages the planet. Paul, his wife Sarah, and their teenage son Travis are secluded in their home deep in the woods in an undisclosed location. After Sarah's father, Bud, contracts the disease, they kill him, and burn his body in a shallow grave. The next night, they capture an intruder breaking into the house. Paul ties him to a tree, and places a bag over his head overnight to confirm he is not suffering from the disease. The stranger, Will, explains he did not know the house was occupied, and was searching for fresh water for his wife and his young son. Will offers to trade some of their food for water. Sarah suggests bringing the strangers to their home, reasoning the more people, the easier it would be to defend themselves. Paul reluctantly agrees, and drives Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them, while accusing Will of setting him up. Will explains he fought them, and assuages Paul's mistrust.</p><p>Paul returns with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing the rules Paul and Sarah use to stay safe, including a) keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, and b) keeping nighttime excursions to a minimum, the two families establish a sense of normality, and grow closer. One day, Travis's dog Stanley is barking aggressively at and chases an unseen presence in the woods. Travis follows the dog into the woods before Stanley's barking suddenly ceases. Travis insists to Paul and Will he heard something in the woods. They return home after Paul assures Travis that Stanley knows the woods and will find his way home. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he told Paul earlier about his and Kim's activities prior to finding the abandoned house. Paul's response suggests an increasing distrust of Will.</p><p>That evening, Travis discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room suffering from a nightmare. Travis leads him back to his parents' room before hearing a sound from downstairs. Travis finds the front door of the house is slightly-open, and he hears noises. He wakes Paul and Will. They investigate, finding a bleeding and gravely-sick Stanley on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. After Travis reveals the door was open before he came downstairs, Sarah suggests sleepwalking Andrew opened the door. Kim argues the possibility as tensions rise. Paul suspects Andrew is infected, and decides they should quarantine in their separate rooms for a couple days so they can calm down and ensure no one is sick. That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather.</p><p>The next morning, Travis overhears Andrew coughing constantly. A distraught Kim tells Will they need to leave. Travis informs his parents Andrew might be infected, and, as such, he too may be infected. Paul and Sarah don protective masks and gloves, and take weapons to confront Kim and Will. After Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive. Will insists his family is healthy, repeatedly tells Andrew to keep his eyes shut and orders Paul to remove the mask. Will demands Paul give him \"...a fair share...\" of food and water so they can leave. Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will, and force him and his family outside. Will attacks Paul, and tries to beat him to death as Sarah shoots Will in the back. He dies from his wound. Kim flees into the woods with Andrew. Paul fires at them, killing Andrew. Kim hysterically begs Paul to kill her to end her misery, and he does by shooting her.</p><p>Later, Travis awakens in bed, visibly sick. His mother comforts him as he dies. Paul and Sarah, now visibly infected, sit at the dinner table in silence. They share a shattered, devastated look.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Joel Edgerton as Paul, Sarah\u2019s husband and Travis\u2019s father</li><li>Christopher Abbott as Will, Kim\u2019s husband and Andrew\u2019s father</li><li>Carmen Ejogo as Sarah, Paul\u2019s wife and Travis\u2019s mother</li><li>Riley Keough as Kim, Will\u2019s wife and Andrew\u2019s mother</li><li>Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Travis, Paul and Sarah\u2019s son</li><li>Griffin Robert Faulkner as Andrew, Will and Kim\u2019s son</li><li>David Pendleton as Bud, Sarah's father and Travis\u2019s grandfather</li><li>Mickey as Stanley, the family dog</li><li>Chase Joliet and Mick O'Rourke as men who attack Paul and Will</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>Shults began writing the film after the death of his father as a way of dealing with the pain.
