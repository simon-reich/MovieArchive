    "plot": "Lazy court-process clerk and stoner Dale Denton has only one reason to visit his equally lazy dealer Saul Silver: to purchase weed, specifically, a rare new strain called Pineapple Express. But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord, he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene. Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him--and it is. As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia: incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both. All aboard the Pineapple Express.",

The film received generally positive reviews from critics and Franco was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1937, a soldier (Bill Hader) in a military facility is being observed through a two-way mirror smoking marijuana and revealing in his euphoria what he hates about the army. A high-ranking officer closes the project and deems marijuana illegal.\r\nSeventy years later in 2007, Dale Denton (Seth Rogen), a process server visits his drug dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco), to buy marijuana. Saul says he may know Dale's next customer, Ted Jones (Gary Cole). At Ted's house Dale witnesses Ted and a police officer, Carol Brazier (Rosie Perez), shoot a man dead. While fleeing, Dale leaves his roach containing Pineapple Express, a rare strain of marijuana. Ted identifies the strain and sends his henchmen Budlofsky (Kevin Corrigan) and Matheson (Craig Robinson) to Red (Danny McBride), a dealer who tells them about Saul.\r\nBack at Saul's apartment, Dale learns Ted is a drug lord and could trace the roach. Dale and Saul visit Red, who reveals that Ted knows who they are and intends to kill them. Dale and Saul decide they must leave the city. They sell Pineapple Express to raise bus fare but Dale is arrested by Police Liaison Officer Bobbra (Cleo King). Dale tells Bobbra that he witnessed Brazier and Ted murder a man. Bobbra has long been suspicious of Brazier's corruption and says she will investigate; however, Saul, thinking that it is Brazier driving, hijacks the police car. Brazier hears on police radio of Dale's arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase, but they escape. After Dale and Saul argue and split up, Saul is kidnapped and is held in Ted's lair beneath the same military facility from 1937. Dale enlists Red's help to rescue Saul. Red backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured. While Dale and Saul are waiting to be killed, they reconcile and plan an escape.\r\nAsian mobsters attack the barn to avenge their fellow gangster's death, the murder that Dale witnessed. Dale and Saul free themselves but are caught by Matheson. A brawl ensues. Red reappears and drives his car through the barn saving Saul, but is shot by Brazier. A mobster sets off a bomb killing Ted and setting fire to the barn. Red's car explodes and lands on Brazier, killing her. Dale carries Saul from the burning barn and Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them. They talk about their adventure over breakfast at a diner before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital.\r\nCast\r\nSeth Rogen as Dale Denton\r\nJames Franco as Saul Silver\r\nDanny McBride as Red\r\nGary Cole as Ted Jones\r\nKevin Corrigan as Budlofsky\r\nCraig Robinson as Matheson\r\nRosie Perez as Carol Brazier\r\nKen Jeong as Ken\r\nAmber Heard as Angie Anderson\r\nEd Begley Jr. as Robert Anderson\r\nNora Dunn as Shannon Anderson\r\nJoe Lo Truglio as Mr. Edwards\r\nCleo King as Police Liaison Officer Bobbra\r\nBill Hader as Private Miller\r\nJames Remar as General Bratt\r\nDavid McDivitt as Cop with Mole\r\nBibek Adhikari as Angie's ex-boyfriend\r\nTroy Gentile as Troy Jones, Ted's son\r\nConnie Sawyer as Faye Belogus\r\nArthur Napiontek as Clark\r\nDana Lee as Cheung\r\nBobby Lee as Bobby\r\nJustin Long as Justin\r\nProduction\r\nThe inspiration for making Pineapple Express, according to producer Judd Apatow, was Brad Pitt's character in True Romance, a stoner named Floyd. Apatow \"thought it would be funny to make a movie in which you follow that character out of his apartment and watch him get chased by bad guys\". According to Rogen, the ideal production budget was $40 million, but due to the subject matter\u2014\"because it's a weed movie\", as he described it\u2014Sony Pictures allotted $25 million. The film is named after a real cannabis strain called Pineapple Express.\r\nRogen was originally going to play Saul, but Apatow suggested that Franco should play the role instead. After a table read, Rogen agreed, thus casting himself in the role of Dale Denton.\r\nSeth Rogen spoke with musician Huey Lewis about writing and performing the film's theme song in November 2007.\r\nRelease\r\nSony released the film on Wednesday, August 6, 2008 and it grossed $12.1 million on its first day. Over the weekend, it opened at number two behind The Dark Knight with $23.2 million, a five-day total of $41.3 million. The film went on to gross $87.3 million in the U.S. and Canada and $14.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $101.5 million.\r\nMarketing\r\nA \"red-band\" trailer for the film, featuring the song \"Paper Planes\" by M.I.A., leaked in February 2008. Sony Pictures had the video removed from YouTube within a few days of its posting. Patrick Goldstein's Summer Movie Posse of the Los Angeles Times described its incorporation as \"the most impressive use of M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' ever\". The film's makers had been keen on including the song in the film's main trailer and approached M.I.A.'s U.S. label Interscope Records for permission. She added \"Interscope asked me and I was, like, well, since it\u2019s just the trailer, that\u2019s cool. I didn\u2019t really think twice about it\" stating she would have thought more carefully about permitting the song's use if it was in the main film, \"scrutinizing what scene they were using it in and stuff like that\". Pineapple Express had an advance screening at the Just for Laughs Film Festival on July 19, 2008. The film was released on August 6, 2008. Cable network FX pre-bought exclusive rights to air the film after its theatrical run. One particular aspect of the film that has been almost universally praised is the cinematography; Seth Rogen even joked on the commentary that \"even people who hate the movie admit that it's shot well\".\r\nDavid Gordon Green met with Apatow, Rogen and Goldberg on the set of Knocked Up and later on the set of Superbad to discuss the project. Green cited The Blues Brothers, Midnight Run, Running Scared, The Gravy Train and Stir Crazy as sources of inspiration and influence on directing the film.\r\nThere was a sneak peek of the film attached to the Superbad DVD, released on December 4, 2007.\r\nHome media\r\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 6, 2009. Both rated and unrated versions of the film are available. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Australia on December 31, 2008. Both the Blu-ray and 2-disc DVD versions of the film come with a digital copy of the unrated film.\r\nReception\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 201 reviews, and an average rating is 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Both funny and scatter shot, this loose-knit action/buddy/stoner comedy bridges genres and keeps a steady tempo of low ball laughs.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nMichael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune praised the film's script, noting that it \"recalls what made Superbad worth seeing: the sidewinding conversational riffs, the why-am-I-laughing? wordplay.\" However, he was critical of the second half of the film, and felt that the violence in contrast to the comedy of the first half was jarring and gratuitous. Kelly Vance of East Bay Express enjoyed Franco's performance, stating that he \"steals the movie easily\", as well as the authenticity of the film's sets.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nThe original motion picture soundtrack to the film was released on August 5, 2008. Although featured in the trailer for the film, the song \"Paper Planes\" by M.I.A. is not used in the film or on its soundtrack. Following the trailer's release, \"Paper Planes\" gained massive airplay and reached the top 5 on Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Also featured in the film but absent from the soundtrack album are Grace Jones' Sly and Robbie produced cover of Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire\", the former of which can be found on her 1998 compilation Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions.",
