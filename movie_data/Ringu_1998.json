It inspired numerous follow-ups within the Ring franchise and triggered a trend of Western remakes, starting with the 2002 American film The Ring.\r\nPlot\r\nTwo high schoolers, Masami and Tomoko, talk about a videotape that was allegedly recorded in Izu and bears a curse that kills the viewer in one week. Tomoko reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a strange tape and received a call after watching. As soon as Masami returns upstairs, Tomoko witnesses her TV turn on by itself, and soon thereafter is killed by an unseen force.\r\nMeanwhile, the cursed video story is being investigated by Tomoko's maternal aunt; newspaper reporter Reiko Asakawa. When Reiko and her young son Yoichi are at Tomoko's funeral, she discovers that three of Tomoko's friends also died that same night, with their faces twisted in fear. In Tomoko's room the next day, Reiko looks through photos, finding that the four friends stayed in a rental cabin in Izu. One of the photos shows their faces blurred.\r\nReiko arrives at the cabin in Izu, and notices an unlabeled tape on the rental shelf. She watches it for herself: the tape shows a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images, accompanied by a metallic screeching. At the end, she sees a mysterious reflection in the TV and receives a phone call but there are only screeching sounds. Taking the threat of death seriously, she leaves with the tape and enlists her ex-husband, Ry\u016bji Takayama to investigate its origin. Ryuji discovers that Reiko's face is blurred in a photo, like those of Tomoko and her friends. Ry\u016bji watches the tape and tells her to make him a copy. While studying the tape the next day, the two find a hidden message within the tape saying \"frolic in brine, goblins be thine\". Ryuji eventually finds that the message is in a dialect from Izu \u014cshima Island. Reiko later catches Yoichi watching the tape, claiming the ghost of Tomoko told him to.\r\nReiko and Ry\u016bji sail for \u014cshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura. They stay at an inn run by Takashi, Shizuko's brother. Ry\u016bji reveals to Takashi that he knows the old man exposed Shizuko to the media, hoping to make money from it. The media attention attracted Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, who, besides researching ESP, had an affair with Shizuko. Dr. Ikuma held a demonstration, where Shizuko displayed her psychic abilities. However, one journalist spitefully denounced her as a fraud, inciting his other colleagues to do the same. In retaliation, Shizuko's daughter, Sadako, psychokinetically kills the journalist, with his face twisted like Tomoko's. Shortly after, a series of slanderous reports drive Shizuko to commit suicide. Dr. Ikuma was fired and took Sadako away.\r\nReiko and Ry\u016bji deduce that Sadako psionically created the cursed tape to express her fury against the world. The two go back to Izu and uncover a well underneath the cabin. Through a vision, they discover that Dr. Ikuma murdered Sadako and threw her body into the well. They try to find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit. Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finds Sadako's corpse, and they return home, relieved that the curse is seemingly broken.\r\nThe next day, however, Ry\u016bji's TV switches on by itself and shows the image of a well. The vengeful ghost of Sadako crawls out of the well, out of Ry\u016bji's TV set, and frightens him into shock, killing him. Reiko had tried to call Ryuji so she hears his last minutes over the phone and finds out only she is free from the curse. Desperate to save Yoichi, she realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else was what saved her. She drives to her father's house, where she plans to let her son copy the tape and show it to her father.\r\nCast\r\nNanako Matsushima as Reiko Asakawa, a journalist who investigates her niece's death and finds the cursed videotape.\r\nHiroyuki Sanada as Ry\u016bji Takayama, Reiko's ex-husband, a former medical student turned university professor. He has a degree of sixth sense that detects supernatural auras.\r\nRikiya \u014ctaka as Y\u014dichi Asakawa, Reiko's young son who also has a sixth sense like his father.\r\nMiki Nakatani as Mai Takano, Ryuji's student.\r\nY\u016bko Takeuchi as Tomoko \u014cishi, Reiko's niece who watches the cursed videotape and is amongst its first victims.\r\nHitomi Sat\u014d as Masami Kurahashi, Tomoko's best friend.\r\nDaisuke Ban as Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, Sadako's father who threw her down a well.\r\nRie In\u014d as Sadako Yamamura, a girl with psychic powers who was thrown down a well where she died; her spirit lived on within a videotape.\r\nMasako as Shizuko Yamamura, Sadako's mother. She too had psychic powers but a disastrous press demonstration led to her suicide.\r\nMiwako Kaji as Takashi Yamamura, Sadako's uncle who runs an inn on Oshima Island.\r\nYutaka Matsushige as Yoshino, a journalist associate of Reiko.\r\nKatsumi Muramatsu as K\u014dichi Asakawa, Reiko's father.\r\nThemes\r\nCritics have discussed Ring\u2019s preoccupations with Japanese tradition\u2019s collision with modernity. Colette Balmain identifies, \u201cIn the figure of Sadako, Ring vengeful y\u016brei archetype of conventional Japanese horror\u201d. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which \u201cembodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\u201d.\r\nRuth Goldberg argues that Ring expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\u201d. She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her 'natural' role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a doubling effect whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.\r\nJay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on. Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.\r\nProduction\r\nAfter the moderate success of the Ring novel, written by K\u014dji Suzuki and published in 1991, publisher Kadokawa Shoten decided to make a motion picture adaptation of Ring.\r\nScreenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi and director Hideo Nakata collaborated to work on the script after reading Suzuki's novel and watching Ring: Kanzenban, Fuji Television Network's 1995 made-for-TV film, directed by Chisui Takigawa. However, the TV version was re-edited and released on VHS under a new title, Ring: Kanzenban (Ring: The Complete Edition). Nakata did not state which TV version he and Takahashi watched.\r\nIn their film script, Takashi and Nakata changed the protagonist's gender (from male to female), name (from Kazuyuki Asakawa to Reiko Asakawa), marital status (from married to divorced) and child's gender and name (from daughter Yoko to son Yoichi).\r\nWith the budget of US$1.2 million, the entire production took nine months and one week. According to director Nakata, the script and pre-production process took three or four months, shooting five weeks and post-production four months.\r\nThe special effects on the cursed videotape and some parts in the film were shot on a 35 mm film which was passed on in a laboratory in which a computer added a 'grainy' effect. Extended visual effects were used in the part in which the ghost of Sadako Yamamura climbs out of the television. First, they shot the Kabuki Theater actress Rie Ino'o walking backwards in a jerky, exaggerated motion. They then played the film in reverse to portray an unnatural-looking walk for Sadako.\r\nRelease\r\nRing was released in Japan on January 31, 1998 where it was distributed by Toho. Upon release in Japan, Ring became the highest grossing horror film in the country. The film was shown at the 1999 Fantasia Film Festival where it won the first place award for Best Feature in the Asian films section.\r\nVariety stated that Ring's \"most notable success\" has been in Hong Kong, where it became the biggest grosser during the first half of the year, beating popular American films such as The Matrix. On its 1999 Hong Kong release, Ring earned HK$31.2 million (US$4.03 million) during its two-month theatrical run making it Hong Kong's highest-grossing Japanese-language film. This record was later beaten by Stand By Me Doraemon in 2015.\r\nHome media\r\nThe Ring was released directly to home video in the United States by DreamWorks with English subtitles on March 4, 2003.\r\nTo coincide with its 20th anniversary, Arrow Films issued a Blu-ray version of Ring on March 18, 2019 in the UK. Additionally, a Blu-ray box set featuring Ring, the sequels Rasen and Ring 2, and prequel Ring 0, was also released. The transfer features a 4K resolution restoration that was scanned from the film's original camera negative. The picture grading and restoration, which took place at Imagica Labs in Tokyo, was supervised and approved by Ring cinematographer Jun'ichir\u014d Hayashi. Both Arrow's Blu-Ray restoration and the Blu-ray box set were later released in the United States on October 29, 2019.\r\nReception\r\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97% based on 38 reviews, and a weighted average of 7.58 out of 10. The website's \"Critics Consensus\" is that the film \"combines supernatural elements with anxieties about modern technology in a truly frightening and unnerving way.\"\r\nSight & Sound critic Mark Kermode praised the film's \"timeless terror,\" with its \"combination of old folk devils and contemporary moral panics\" which appeal to both teen and adult audiences alike. While Adam Smith of Empire Online finds the film \"throttled by its over complexity, duff plotting and a distinct lack of actual action,\" Kermode emphasizes that \"one is inclined to conclude that it is the telling, rather than the content of the tale, that is all-important.\" Variety agrees that the slow pace, with \"its gradual evocation of evil lying await beneath the surface of normality,\" is one of the film's biggest strengths. Ring has been described as the most frightening film of all time by Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian's film critic. Ring is also listed as the twelfth best horror film of all time by The Guardian.\r\nRing was ranked No. 69 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010. In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Ring placed at number 61 on their top 100 list.\r\nInfluence\r\nThe international success of the Japanese films launched a revival of horror filmmaking in Japan that resulted in such pictures as Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 2001 film Pulse (known as Circuit (\u56de\u8def, Kairo) in Japan), Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge (\u546a\u6028, Juon) (2000), Hideo Nakata's Dark Water (\u4ec4\u6697\u3044\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u304b\u3089, Honogurai mizu no soko kara, literally From the Depths of Dark Water), also based on a short story by Suzuki), and Higuchinsky's Uzumaki (2000, a.k.a. Vortex, based on the Junji It\u014d horror manga of the same name).\r\nInfluence on Western cinema\r\nRing had some influence on Western cinema and gained cult status in the West.\r\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hollywood horror had largely been dominated by the slasher sub-genre, which relied on on-screen violence, shock tactics, and gore. Ring, whose release in Japan roughly coincided with The Blair Witch Project in the United States, helped to revitalise the genre by taking a more restrained approach to horror, leaving much of the terror to the audience's imagination. The film initiated global interest in Japanese cinema in general and Japanese horror cinema in particular, a renaissance which led to the coining of the term J-Horror in the West. This \"New Asian Horror\" resulted in further successful releases, such as Ju-on: The Grudge and Dark Water. In addition to Japanese productions this boom also managed to bring attention to similar films made in other East Asian nations at the same time such as Korea (A Tale of Two Sisters) and Hong Kong (The Eye).\r\nAll of these films were later remade in the US. Released in 2002, The Ring reached number 1 at the box office and grossed more in Japan than the original.\r\nSequels and remake\r\nThe original sequel was Rasen, however, due to poor reception, a new sequel, Ring 2, was released in 1999 which continued the storyline of this film. Then, it was followed by a 2000 prequel, Ring 0: Birthday. A television series, Ring: The Final Chapter, was made, with a similar storyline but many changes in characters and their backstories. An American remake, The Ring, was made in 2002 .",

Colette Balmain identifies, \u201cIn the figure of Sadako, Ring vengeful y\u016brei archetype of conventional Japanese horror\u201d. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which \u201cembodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\u201d.</p><p>Ruth Goldberg argues that Ring expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\u201d. She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her 'natural' role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a doubling effect whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.</p><p>Jay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on. Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs expansion</b>. <small>You can help by <span class=\"external text\">adding to it</span>.</small>  <small class=\"date-container\"><i>(<span class=\"date\">November 2016</span>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>After the moderate success of the Ring novel, written by K\u014dji Suzuki and published in 1991, publisher Kadokawa Shoten decided to make a motion picture adaptation of Ring.</p><p>Screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi and director Hideo Nakata collaborated to work on the script after reading Suzuki's novel and watching Ring: Kanzenban, Fuji Television Network's 1995 made-for-TV film, directed by Chisui Takigawa. However, the TV version was re-edited and released on VHS under a new title, Ring: Kanzenban (Ring: The Complete Edition). Nakata did not state which TV version he and Takahashi watched.</p><p>In their film script, Takashi and Nakata changed the protagonist's gender (from male to female), name (from Kazuyuki Asakawa to Reiko Asakawa), marital status (from married to divorced) and child's gender and name (from daughter Yoko to son Yoichi).</p><p>With the budget of US$1.2 million, the entire production took nine months and one week. According to director Nakata, the script and pre-production process took three or four months, shooting five weeks and post-production four months.</p><p>The special effects on the cursed videotape and some parts in the film were shot on a 35 mm film which was passed on in a laboratory in which a computer added a 'grainy' effect. Extended visual effects were used in the part in which the ghost of Sadako Yamamura climbs out of the television. First, they shot the Kabuki Theater actress Rie Ino'o walking backwards in a jerky, exaggerated motion. They then played the film in reverse to portray an unnatural-looking walk for Sadako.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>Ring was released in Japan on January 31, 1998 where it was distributed by Toho. Upon release in Japan, Ring became the highest grossing horror film in the country. The film was shown at the 1999 Fantasia Film Festival where it won the first place award for Best Feature in the Asian films section.</p><p>Variety stated that Ring's \"most notable success\" has been in Hong Kong, where it became the biggest grosser during the first half of the year, beating popular American films such as The Matrix. On its 1999 Hong Kong release, Ring earned HK$31.2 million (US$4.03 million) during its two-month theatrical run making it Hong Kong's highest-grossing Japanese-language film. This record was later beaten by Stand By Me Doraemon in 2015.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>The Ring was released directly to home video in the United States by DreamWorks with English subtitles on March 4, 2003.</p><p>To coincide with its 20th anniversary, Arrow Films issued a Blu-ray version of Ring on March 18, 2019 in the UK. Additionally, a Blu-ray box set featuring Ring, the sequels Rasen and Ring 2, and prequel Ring 0, was also released. The transfer features a 4K resolution restoration that was scanned from the film's original camera negative. The picture grading and restoration, which took place at Imagica Labs in Tokyo, was supervised and approved by Ring cinematographer Jun'ichir\u014d Hayashi. Both Arrow's Blu-Ray restoration and the Blu-ray box set were later released in the United States on October 29, 2019.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs expansion</b>. <small>You can help by <span class=\"external text\">adding to it</span>.</small>  <small class=\"date-container\"><i>(<span class=\"date\">November 2016</span>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97% based on 38 reviews, and a weighted average of 7.58 out of 10. The website's \"Critics Consensus\" is that the film \"combines supernatural elements with anxieties about modern technology in a truly frightening and unnerving way.\"</p><p>Sight & Sound critic Mark Kermode praised the film's \"timeless terror,\" with its \"combination of old folk devils and contemporary moral panics\" which appeal to both teen and adult audiences alike. While Adam Smith of Empire Online finds the film \"throttled by its over complexity, duff plotting and a distinct lack of actual action,\" Kermode emphasizes that \"one is inclined to conclude that it is the telling, rather than the content of the tale, that is all-important.\" Variety agrees that the slow pace, with \"its gradual evocation of evil lying await beneath the surface of normality,\" is one of the film's biggest strengths. Ring has been described as the most frightening film of all time by Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian's film critic. Ring is also listed as the twelfth best horror film of all time by The Guardian.</p><p>Ring was ranked No. 69 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010. In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Ring placed at number 61 on their top 100 list.</p><br/><h3>Influence</h3><p>The international success of the Japanese films launched a revival of horror filmmaking in Japan that resulted in such pictures as Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 2001 film Pulse (known as Circuit (\u56de\u8def, Kairo) in Japan), Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge (\u546a\u6028, Juon) (2000), Hideo Nakata's Dark Water (\u4ec4\u6697\u3044\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u304b\u3089, Honogurai mizu no soko kara, literally From the Depths of Dark Water), also based on a short story by Suzuki), and Higuchinsky's Uzumaki (2000, a.k.a. Vortex, based on the Junji It\u014d horror manga of the same name).</p><h4>Influence on Western cinema</h4><p>Ring had some influence on Western cinema and gained cult status in the West.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hollywood horror had largely been dominated by the slasher sub-genre, which relied on on-screen violence, shock tactics, and gore. Ring, whose release in Japan roughly coincided with The Blair Witch Project in the United States, helped to revitalise the genre by taking a more restrained approach to horror, leaving much of the terror to the audience's imagination. The film initiated global interest in Japanese cinema in general and Japanese horror cinema in particular, a renaissance which led to the coining of the term J-Horror in the West. This \"New Asian Horror\" resulted in further successful releases, such as Ju-on: The Grudge and Dark Water. In addition to Japanese productions this boom also managed to bring attention to similar films made in other East Asian nations at the same time such as Korea (A Tale of Two Sisters) and Hong Kong (The Eye).</p><p>All of these films were later remade in the US. Released in 2002, The Ring reached number 1 at the box office and grossed more in Japan than the original.</p><br/><h3>Sequels and remake</h3><p>The original sequel was Rasen, however, due to poor reception, a new sequel, Ring 2, was released in 1999 which continued the storyline of this film. Then, it was followed by a 2000 prequel, Ring 0: Birthday. A television series, Ring: The Final Chapter, was made, with a similar storyline but many changes in characters and their backstories. An American remake, The Ring, was made in 2002 .</p><br/>"
