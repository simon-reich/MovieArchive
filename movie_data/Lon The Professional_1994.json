It stars Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, and Natalie Portman (in her film debut).

L\u00e9on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and learns the hitman's trade.\r\nPlot\r\nL\u00e9on Montana is a hitman (or \"cleaner\", as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named \"Old Tony\".\r\nOne day, L\u00e9on meets Mathilda Lando, a lonely 12-year-old girl. Mathilda lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep for himself, DEA agents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield. During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family while she is out shopping for groceries. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to L\u00e9on's apartment; he hesitantly gives her shelter.\r\nMathilda quickly discovers that L\u00e9on is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, L\u00e9on is unsettled by her presence, and considers murdering her, but he eventually trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In exchange, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment, and teaches him how to read. In time, the pair form a close bond. Mathilda looks up to L\u00e9on and quickly develops a crush for him, often telling him she loves him, but he refuses to reciprocate.\r\nWhen L\u00e9on heads out for an apparent assignment, Mathilda fills a bag with guns from L\u00e9on's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom; one of his men arrives and announces that L\u00e9on had just killed Malky, one of the corrupt DEA agents, in Chinatown that morning. L\u00e9on, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, killing two more of Stansfield's men in the process. An enraged Stansfield confronts Tony, who is violently interrogated for L\u00e9on's whereabouts.\r\nAs Mathilda and L\u00e9on recover from the ordeal, L\u00e9on tells her about how he became a cleaner; when L\u00e9on was young in Italy, he was in love with a girl from a wealthy family. The two made plans to elope, but when the girl's father discovered their relationship, he killed her out of anger and escaped justice. L\u00e9on killed the father out of revenge and fled to New York, where he met Tony and trained to become a cleaner.\r\nLater, while Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, a NYPD ESU team sent by Stansfield captures her and attempts to infiltrate L\u00e9on's apartment. L\u00e9on ambushes the ESU team and rescues Mathilda. L\u00e9on creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft; he tells her to meet him at Tony's place in an hour, and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police blow up the apartment. In the chaos that follows, L\u00e9on sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer; he goes unnoticed save for Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back. As he is dying, L\u00e9on places an object in Stansfield's hands that he says is \"from Mathilda\"; Stansfield discovers that it is a grenade pin. He then opens L\u00e9on's vest to find a cluster of active grenades, which promptly detonate, killing Stansfield.\r\nMathilda goes to Tony, as L\u00e9on had told her to do earlier. Mathilda tries to convince Tony to hire her in Leon's place, but Tony flatly refuses to hire a twelve-year-old, and tells Mathilda he had been instructed by L\u00e9on to give his money to her if anything happened to him. He gives Mathilda $100 from Leon's funds as an allowance, and sends her back to school, where the headmistress re-admits her after Mathilda reveals what had happened to her. She then walks onto a field near the school to plant L\u00e9on's houseplant, as she had told L\u00e9on that he should \"give it roots\".\r\nCast\r\nJean Reno as L\u00e9on Montana\r\nNatalie Portman as Mathilda Lando\r\nGary Oldman as Norman Stansfield\r\nDanny Aiello as Tony\r\nMichael Badalucco as Mathilda's father\r\nEllen Greene as Mathilda's stepmother\r\nElizabeth Regen as Mathilda's sister\r\nPeter Appel as Malky\r\nAdam Busch as Manolo\r\nJoseph Malerba as Stairway Swat\r\nMa\u00efwenn as The Blond Babe\r\nGeorge Martin as The Hotel Receptionist\r\nJean-Hugues Anglade as Cameo\r\nKeith A. Glascoe as Benny\r\nProduction\r\nL\u00e9on: The Professional is to some extent an expansion of an idea in Besson's earlier 1990 film, La Femme Nikita (in some countries Nikita). In La Femme Nikita, Jean Reno plays a similar character named Victor. Besson described L\u00e9on as \"Now maybe Jean is playing the American cousin of Victor. This time he's more human.\"\r\nWhile most of the interior footage was shot in France, the rest of the film was shot on location in New York City. The final scene at school was filmed at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nA soundtrack for the film was released in October 1994 by TriStar Music. It was commercially successful in Japan, being certified gold for 100,000 copies shipped in December 1999.\r\nRelease\r\nL\u00e9on: The Professional was released in France on 14 September 1994. On its first week in Paris, the film sold 243,285 tickets and a total of 797,939 tickets in Paris on its initial theatrical run. In France overall, it sold 3,330,703 tickets. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $45 million worldwide on a $16 million budget.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nL\u00e9on: The Professional received positive reviews from critics. The film holds a 73% positive aggregate rating based on 61 critical reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus states, \"Pivoting on the unusual relationship between seasoned hitman and his 12-year-old apprentice\u2014a breakout turn by young Natalie Portman\u2014Luc Besson's L\u00e9on is a stylish and oddly affecting thriller\". At Metacritic, the film received an average score of 64 based on 12 reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".\r\nMark Salisbury of Empire magazine awarded the film a full five stars. He said, \"Oozing style, wit and confidence from every sprocket, and offering a dizzyingly, fresh perspective on the Big Apple that only Besson could bring, this is, in a word, wonderful\". Mark Deming at AllMovie awarded the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"As visually stylish as it is graphically violent\", and featuring \"a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman\". Richard Schickel of Time magazine lauded the film, writing, \"this is a Cuisinart of a movie, mixing familiar yet disparate ingredients, making something odd, possibly distasteful, undeniably arresting out of them\". He praised Oldman's performance as \"divinely psychotic\".\r\nRoger Ebert awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing: \"It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style. And it is well acted.\" However, he was not entirely complimentary: \"Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action. ... In what is essentially an exercise\u2014a slick urban thriller\u2014it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.\"The New York Times' Janet Maslin wrote, \"The Professional is much too sentimental to sound shockingly amoral in the least. Even in a finale of extravagant violence, it manages to be maudlin \u2026 Mr. Oldman expresses most of the film's sadism as well as many of its misguidedly poetic sentiments.\"\r\nAccolades\r\nL\u00e9on: The Professional won the Czech Lion Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing \u2013 Foreign Feature. The film also received seven nominations at the 20th C\u00e9sar Awards, for Best Film, Best Director for Besson, Best Actor for Reno, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, and Best Sound.\r\nLegacy\r\nIn the 2013 book, Poseur: A Memoir of Downtown New York City in the '90s, Marc Spitz wrote that the film is \"considered a cult classic\". In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films; L\u00e9on: The Professional was listed at No. 42. The character Norman Stansfield has since been named as one of cinema's greatest villains.\r\nThe British band Alt-J released a song about the film, titled \"Matilda\". The first line in the lyrics, \"this is from Matilda\", refer to L\u00e9on's last words to Stansfield, shortly before the grenades detonate and kills them. The Bollywood film Bichhoo was inspired by L\u00e9on: The Professional.\r\nIn 2014, Somali-British director Mo Ali made his second directorial feature Montana, a British action film. The film was inspired by both L\u00e9on and The Karate Kid.\r\nSouth Korean comedian Park Myeong-su and singer-songwriter IU released and performed a song inspired by the film, \"Leon\", for a bi-annual music festival of South Korea's highly popular variety show, Infinite Challenge, in 2015.\r\nSequel\r\nBesson wrote a script for a sequel, Mathilda, but filming was delayed until Portman was older. In the script, Mathilda was described as \"older\" and \"more mature,\" and was working as a cleaner. However, in the meantime, Besson left Gaumont Film Company to start his own movie studio, EuropaCorp. Unhappy at Besson's departure, Gaumont Film Company \"has held The Professional rights close to the vest \u2014 and will not budge\".\r\nIn 2011, director Olivier Megaton told reporters that he and Besson used the script for Mathilda as the basis for Colombiana, a film about a young cleaner played by Zoe Saldana. Like Mathilda, her character goes to war with a drug cartel as revenge for the murder of her family when she was a child.\r\nExtended version\r\nThere is also an extended version of the film, referred to as \"international version,\" \"version longue,\" or \"version int\u00e9grale\". Containing 25 minutes of additional footage, it is sometimes called the \"Director's Cut\" but Besson refers to the original version as the Director's Cut and the new version as \"The Long Version\". According to Besson, this is the version he wanted to release, but for the fact that the extra scenes tested poorly with Los Angeles preview audiences. The additional material is found in the film's second act, and it depicts more of the interactions and relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda, as well as explicitly demonstrating how Mathilda accompanies L\u00e9on on several of his hits as \"a full co-conspirator\", to further her training as a contracted killer.\r\nThe extended version of L\u00e9on was shown as \"version longue\" in French cinemas in 1996, and then released on VHS. It was subsequently released as \"version int\u00e9grale\" on LaserDisc and later Region 2 DVD in Japan. It appeared as the \"international version\" on Region 1 DVD in North America in 2000, and was re-issued in 2005. It was first released in the United Kingdom in 2009 as the \"Director's Cut.\"",

L\u00e9on creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft; he tells her to meet him at Tony's place in an hour, and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police blow up the apartment. In the chaos that follows, L\u00e9on sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer; he goes unnoticed save for Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back. As he is dying, L\u00e9on places an object in Stansfield's hands that he says is \"from Mathilda\"; Stansfield discovers that it is a grenade pin. He then opens L\u00e9on's vest to find a cluster of active grenades, which promptly detonate, killing Stansfield.</p><p>Mathilda goes to Tony, as L\u00e9on had told her to do earlier. Mathilda tries to convince Tony to hire her in Leon's place, but Tony flatly refuses to hire a twelve-year-old, and tells Mathilda he had been instructed by L\u00e9on to give his money to her if anything happened to him. He gives Mathilda $100 from Leon's funds as an allowance, and sends her back to school, where the headmistress re-admits her after Mathilda reveals what had happened to her. She then walks onto a field near the school to plant L\u00e9on's houseplant, as she had told L\u00e9on that he should \"give it roots\".</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Jean Reno as L\u00e9on Montana</li><li>Natalie Portman as Mathilda Lando</li><li>Gary Oldman as Norman Stansfield</li><li>Danny Aiello as Tony</li><li>Michael Badalucco as Mathilda's father</li><li>Ellen Greene as Mathilda's stepmother</li><li>Elizabeth Regen as Mathilda's sister</li><li>Peter Appel as Malky</li><li>Adam Busch as Manolo</li><li>Joseph Malerba as Stairway Swat</li><li>Ma\u00efwenn as The Blond Babe</li><li>George Martin as The Hotel Receptionist</li><li>Jean-Hugues Anglade as Cameo</li><li>Keith A. Glascoe as Benny</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>L\u00e9on: The Professional is to some extent an expansion of an idea in Besson's earlier 1990 film, La Femme Nikita (in some countries Nikita). In La Femme Nikita, Jean Reno plays a similar character named Victor. Besson described L\u00e9on as \"Now maybe Jean is playing the American cousin of Victor. This time he's more human.\"</p><p>While most of the interior footage was shot in France, the rest of the film was shot on location in New York City. The final scene at school was filmed at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p><br/><h3>Soundtrack</h3><p>A soundtrack for the film was released in October 1994 by TriStar Music. It was commercially successful in Japan, being certified gold for 100,000 copies shipped in December 1999.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>L\u00e9on: The Professional was released in France on 14 September 1994. On its first week in Paris, the film sold 243,285 tickets and a total of 797,939 tickets in Paris on its initial theatrical run. In France overall, it sold 3,330,703 tickets. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $45 million worldwide on a $16 million budget.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><p>L\u00e9on: The Professional received positive reviews from critics. The film holds a 73% positive aggregate rating based on 61 critical reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus states, \"Pivoting on the unusual relationship between seasoned hitman and his 12-year-old apprentice\u2014a breakout turn by young Natalie Portman\u2014Luc Besson's L\u00e9on is a stylish and oddly affecting thriller\". At Metacritic, the film received an average score of 64 based on 12 reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>Mark Salisbury of Empire magazine awarded the film a full five stars. He said, \"Oozing style, wit and confidence from every sprocket, and offering a dizzyingly, fresh perspective on the Big Apple that only Besson could bring, this is, in a word, wonderful\". Mark Deming at AllMovie awarded the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"As visually stylish as it is graphically violent\", and featuring \"a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman\". Richard Schickel of Time magazine lauded the film, writing, \"this is a Cuisinart of a movie, mixing familiar yet disparate ingredients, making something odd, possibly distasteful, undeniably arresting out of them\". He praised Oldman's performance as \"divinely psychotic\".</p><p>Roger Ebert awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing: \"It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style. And it is well acted.\" However, he was not entirely complimentary: \"Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action. ... In what is essentially an exercise\u2014a slick urban thriller\u2014it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.\"The New York Times' Janet Maslin wrote, \"The Professional is much too sentimental to sound shockingly amoral in the least. Even in a finale of extravagant violence, it manages to be maudlin \u2026 Mr. Oldman expresses most of the film's sadism as well as many of its misguidedly poetic sentiments.\"</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>L\u00e9on: The Professional won the Czech Lion Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing \u2013 Foreign Feature. The film also received seven nominations at the 20th C\u00e9sar Awards, for Best Film, Best Director for Besson, Best Actor for Reno, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, and Best Sound.</p><br/><h3>Legacy</h3><p>In the 2013 book, Poseur: A Memoir of Downtown New York City in the '90s, Marc Spitz wrote that the film is \"considered a cult classic\". In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films; L\u00e9on: The Professional was listed at No. 42. The character Norman Stansfield has since been named as one of cinema's greatest villains.</p><p>The British band Alt-J released a song about the film, titled \"Matilda\". The first line in the lyrics, \"this is from Matilda\", refer to L\u00e9on's last words to Stansfield, shortly before the grenades detonate and kills them. The Bollywood film Bichhoo was inspired by L\u00e9on: The Professional.</p><p>In 2014, Somali-British director Mo Ali made his second directorial feature Montana, a British action film. The film was inspired by both L\u00e9on and The Karate Kid.</p><p>South Korean comedian Park Myeong-su and singer-songwriter IU released and performed a song inspired by the film, \"Leon\", for a bi-annual music festival of South Korea's highly popular variety show, Infinite Challenge, in 2015.</p><br/><h3>Sequel</h3><p>Besson wrote a script for a sequel, Mathilda, but filming was delayed until Portman was older. In the script, Mathilda was described as \"older\" and \"more mature,\" and was working as a cleaner. However, in the meantime, Besson left Gaumont Film Company to start his own movie studio, EuropaCorp. Unhappy at Besson's departure, Gaumont Film Company \"has held The Professional rights close to the vest \u2014 and will not budge\".</p><p>In 2011, director Olivier Megaton told reporters that he and Besson used the script for Mathilda as the basis for Colombiana, a film about a young cleaner played by Zoe Saldana. Like Mathilda, her character goes to war with a drug cartel as revenge for the murder of her family when she was a child.</p><br/><h3>Extended version</h3><p>There is also an extended version of the film, referred to as \"international version,\" \"version longue,\" or \"version int\u00e9grale\". Containing 25 minutes of additional footage, it is sometimes called the \"Director's Cut\" but Besson refers to the original version as the Director's Cut and the new version as \"The Long Version\". According to Besson, this is the version he wanted to release, but for the fact that the extra scenes tested poorly with Los Angeles preview audiences. The additional material is found in the film's second act, and it depicts more of the interactions and relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda, as well as explicitly demonstrating how Mathilda accompanies L\u00e9on on several of his hits as \"a full co-conspirator\", to further her training as a contracted killer.</p><p>The extended version of L\u00e9on was shown as \"version longue\" in French cinemas in 1996, and then released on VHS. It was subsequently released as \"version int\u00e9grale\" on LaserDisc and later Region 2 DVD in Japan. It appeared as the \"international version\" on Region 1 DVD in North America in 2000, and was re-issued in 2005. It was first released in the United Kingdom in 2009 as the \"Director's Cut.\"</p><br/>"
