    "plot": "Mr. Turner explores the last quarter century of the great if eccentric British painter J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851). Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by a housekeeper he takes for granted and occasionally exploits sexually, he forms a close relationship with a seaside landlady with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies. Throughout this, he travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits brothels, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty.",

M. W. Turner's life. Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by his housekeeper, Hannah Danby, whom he takes for granted and occasionally uses sexually, he forms a close and loving relationship with a seaside landlady, Mrs. Booth, with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies.\r\nTurner travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits a brothel, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty.\r\nCast\r\nTimothy Spall as J. M. W. Turner: The controversial artist; he never married but had two lovers. He fathered two children with one, though he denied paternity.\r\nDorothy Atkinson as Hannah Danby (1786\u20141853): Turner's devoted housekeeper for 40 years, whom he exploits sexually in the film. (Leigh said that the sexual relationship was \"an invention not based on any historical evidence\".) She suffered from the skin disease psoriasis and died two years after Turner.\r\nMarion Bailey as Sophia Booth (1798\u20141875): Turner's landlady and lover, twice widowed, with one son by her first husband. After her second husband died, she became involved with Turner.\r\nPaul Jesson as William Turner Snr (1745\u20141829): Turner's father, a barber. His wife died young in a mental hospital, and their only other child died at 5. He lived with his artist son until his death, which deeply affected Turner.\r\nLesley Manville as Mary Somerville, a scientist and friend of Turner. She gained renown at a time when women engaging seriously in scientific study was not condoned.\r\nMartin Savage as Benjamin Robert Haydon: Turner's friend, an artist who committed suicide.\r\nRuth Sheen as Sarah Danby (1760\u20141861): Hannah's aunt by marriage and Turner's first lover and the mother of his two unacknowledged daughters. Her husband and Hannah's uncle, a musician, had died, leaving her a young widow.\r\nDavid Horovitch as Dr Price: Turner's doctor\r\nKarl Johnson as Mr. Booth, a sea captain and second husband of Sophia Booth\r\nPeter Wight as Joseph Gillott: wealthy arts patron\r\nJoshua McGuire as John Ruskin\r\nStuart McQuarrie as Ruskin's father\r\nSylvestra Le Touzel as Ruskin's mother\r\nLeo Bill as J. E. Mayall: pioneering photographer\r\nKate O'Flynn as Prostitute: Eliza is the young prostitute sketched by Turner.\r\nSinead Matthews as Queen Victoria: the young queen who sneers at Turner's later work.\r\nKarina Fernandez as Miss Coggins: musician who plays Dido's Lament by Henry Purcell, to Turner's singing.\r\nRichard Bremmer as George Jones: artist famous of battle scenes\r\nMark Stanley as Clarkson Stanfield: marine painter\r\nJamie Thomas King as David Roberts: Scottish Orientalist painter\r\nTom Wlaschiha as Prince Albert\r\nPatrick Godfrey as Lord Egremont: arts patron (such as Carew) and owner of Petworth House where Turner spent much time.\r\nNiall Buggy as John Carew: Irish sculptor\r\nFred Pearson as Sir William Beechy: portrait painter\r\nTom Edden as C. R. Leslie: genre painter\r\nClive Francis as Martin Archer Shee: portrait painter\r\nRobert Portal as Sir Charles Eastlake: painter and gallery director\r\nJames Fleet as John Constable: landscape painter, doyen of the Romantic movement\r\nNicholas Jones as Sir John Soane: neo-classical architect and art collector\r\nRoger Ashton-Griffiths as Henry William Pickersgill: portrait painter\r\nSimon Chandler as Sir Augustus Wall Callcott: landscape artist.\r\nEdward de Souza as Thomas Stothard: painter and engraver\r\nOliver Maltman as theatre actor\r\nSam Kelly as theatre actor\r\nProduction\r\nMr. Turner was filmed in several locations around the UK. Margate was not used to represent Turner's Margate, but the production visited Kent to shoot a couple of scenes. HMS Gannet in the Historic Dockyard Chatham was used in the scene where Turner has himself strapped to the mast of a sailing ship during a storm. Stangate Creek doubled as the Thames when Turner and his friends are rowed along the Thames and discuss HMS Victory, then toast HMS Temeraire.\r\nRelease\r\nMr. Turner had its premiere at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, with Spall winning Best Actor and Dick Pope winning the Vulcan Award. Entertainment One released the film in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2014. Sony Pictures Classics handled the United States distribution, with a release date of 19 December 2014. It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.\r\nPiracy\r\nThe film was leaked by the hacker group \"Guardians of Peace\" onto peer-to-peer file sharing websites on 27 November 2014, more than three weeks ahead of its intended U.S. theatrical release, as part of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack. Along with it came Fury and three other then unreleased Sony Pictures films (Annie, Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms). Within three days of the initial leak, an estimated 63,379 unique IPs had downloaded Mr. Turner.\r\nCritical reception\r\nMr. Turner received wide praise from critics. Spall's performance was lauded, along with Yershon's score and Pope's cinematography. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 97%, based on 191 reviews, with an average score of 8.46/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Led by a masterful performance from Timothy Spall and brilliantly directed by Mike Leigh, Mr. Turner is a superior Hollywood biopic.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 94 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nCritic Katie Kilkenny of The Atlantic called it \"a gorgeous, important film\". Observer critic Mark Kermode described the film as a \"portrait of a man wrestling light with his hands as if it were a physical element: tangible, malleable, corporeal\". Slate reviewer Dana Stevens wrote, \"Writing about Mr. Turner a few weeks after seeing it, I feel a craving to be again immersed in its world, which is rich with colors, textures, and, it sometimes almost seems, smells\".\r\nThe consonance between the film and its subject was addressed by Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Galleries in England: \u201cMike Leigh and Timothy Spall\u2019s great achievement is showing us how the artist approached the physical business of painting. But they also convey the spirit of a man whose reputation as a curmudgeon is unwarranted, given his passionate interest in people and the world around him. There is a great humanitarian streak in Turner and Mike Leigh has found a way of capturing this on film, as he has done so often before.\u201d\r\nMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half out of four stars, writing that like Leigh's 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, about the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado, \" understands creative people on every conceivable level, and translates that understanding with a deftness rarely seen outside of astute documentaries about creative people. To watch it is to feel as though you're a part of its world... experiencing tiny fluctuations in received wisdom and sudden changes of artistic direction that can only be sensed by professionals who are plugged into their art form, and completely in command of their talents.\"\r\nAccolades",

It premiered in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where Spall won the award for Best Actor and Dick Pope received a special jury prize for the film's cinematography.</p><p>The film was critically acclaimed and received four nominations each at the 87th Academy Awards and 68th British Academy Film Awards.</p><p>Describing Turner as \"a great artist: a radical, revolutionary painter\", writer/director Leigh explained, \"I felt there was scope for a film examining the tension between this very mortal, flawed individual, and the epic work, the spiritual way he had of distilling the world\".</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>The film depicts the last quarter-century of the British painter J. M. W. Turner's life. Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by his housekeeper, Hannah Danby, whom he takes for granted and occasionally uses sexually, he forms a close and loving relationship with a seaside landlady, Mrs. Booth, with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies.</p><p>Turner travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits a brothel, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Timothy Spall as J. M. W. Turner: The controversial artist; he never married but had two lovers. He fathered two children with one, though he denied paternity.</li><li>Dorothy Atkinson as Hannah Danby (1786\u20141853): Turner's devoted housekeeper for 40 years, whom he exploits sexually in the film.

After her second husband died, she became involved with Turner.</li><li>Paul Jesson as William Turner Snr (1745\u20141829): Turner's father, a barber. His wife died young in a mental hospital, and their only other child died at 5. He lived with his artist son until his death, which deeply affected Turner.</li><li>Lesley Manville as Mary Somerville, a scientist and friend of Turner. She gained renown at a time when women engaging seriously in scientific study was not condoned.</li><li>Martin Savage as Benjamin Robert Haydon: Turner's friend, an artist who committed suicide.</li><li>Ruth Sheen as Sarah Danby (1760\u20141861): Hannah's aunt by marriage and Turner's first lover and the mother of his two unacknowledged daughters.

Margate was not used to represent Turner's Margate, but the production visited Kent to shoot a couple of scenes. HMS Gannet in the Historic Dockyard Chatham was used in the scene where Turner has himself strapped to the mast of a sailing ship during a storm. Stangate Creek doubled as the Thames when Turner and his friends are rowed along the Thames and discuss HMS Victory, then toast HMS Temeraire.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>Mr. Turner had its premiere at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, with Spall winning Best Actor and Dick Pope winning the Vulcan Award. Entertainment One released the film in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2014. Sony Pictures Classics handled the United States distribution, with a release date of 19 December 2014. It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.</p><h4>Piracy</h4><p>The film was leaked by the hacker group \"Guardians of Peace\" onto peer-to-peer file sharing websites on 27 November 2014, more than three weeks ahead of its intended U.S. theatrical release, as part of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack. Along with it came Fury and three other then unreleased Sony Pictures films (Annie, Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms). Within three days of the initial leak, an estimated 63,379 unique IPs had downloaded Mr. Turner.</p><br/><h3>Critical reception</h3><p>Mr. Turner received wide praise from critics. Spall's performance was lauded, along with Yershon's score and Pope's cinematography. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 97%, based on 191 reviews, with an average score of 8.46/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Led by a masterful performance from Timothy Spall and brilliantly directed by Mike Leigh, Mr. Turner is a superior Hollywood biopic.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 94 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Critic Katie Kilkenny of The Atlantic called it \"a gorgeous, important film\". Observer critic Mark Kermode described the film as a \"portrait of a man wrestling light with his hands as if it were a physical element: tangible, malleable, corporeal\". Slate reviewer Dana Stevens wrote, \"Writing about Mr. Turner a few weeks after seeing it, I feel a craving to be again immersed in its world, which is rich with colors, textures, and, it sometimes almost seems, smells\".</p><p>The consonance between the film and its subject was addressed by Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Galleries in England: \u201cMike Leigh and Timothy Spall\u2019s great achievement is showing us how the artist approached the physical business of painting. But they also convey the spirit of a man whose reputation as a curmudgeon is unwarranted, given his passionate interest in people and the world around him. There is a great humanitarian streak in Turner and Mike Leigh has found a way of capturing this on film, as he has done so often before.\u201d</p><p>Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half out of four stars, writing that like Leigh's 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, about the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado, \" understands creative people on every conceivable level, and translates that understanding with a deftness rarely seen outside of astute documentaries about creative people. To watch it is to feel as though you're a part of its world... experiencing tiny fluctuations in received wisdom and sudden changes of artistic direction that can only be sensed by professionals who are plugged into their art form, and completely in command of their talents.\"</p><br/><h3>Accolades</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"text-align:center;\"><th colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\">List of awards and nominations</th></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;\"><th style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"40%\">Award / Film Festival</th><th style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"30%\">Category</th><th style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"25%\">Recipient(s)</th><th style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"15%\">Result</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"><span>87th Academy Awards</span></td><td><span>Best Cinematography</span></td><td><span>Dick Pope</span></td><td style=\"background: #FDD;
