    "plot": "Set in 1960, the film centres on the young, boyishly handsome Yuddy, who learns from the drunken ex-prostitute who raised him that she is not his real mother. Hoping to hold onto him, she refuses to divulge the name of his real birth mother. The revelation shakes Yuddy to his very core, unleashing a cascade of conflicting emotions. Two women have the bad luck to fall for Yuddy. One is a quiet lass named Su Lizhen who works at a sports arena, while the other is a glitzy showgirl named Mimi. Perhaps due to his unresolved Oedipal issues, he passively lets the two compete for him, unable or unwilling to make a choice. As Lizhen slowly confides her frustration to a cop named Tide, he falls for her. The same is true for Yuddy's friend Zeb, who falls for Mimi. Later, Yuddy learns of his birth mother's whereabouts and heads out to the Philippines.",

Yuddy, or 'York' in English (Leslie Cheung), is a playboy in Hong Kong and is well known for stealing girls' hearts and breaking them. His first lover in the film is Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), who suffers emotional and mental depression as a result of Yuddy's wayward attitude. Li-zhen eventually seeks much-needed solace from a sympathetic policeman named Tide (Andy Lau). Their near-romance is often hinted at but never materializes.\r\nYork's next romance is with a vivacious cabaret dancer whose stage name is Mimi (Carina Lau). Mimi is also loved by York's best friend, Zeb (Jacky Cheung). Unsurprisingly, York dumps her too and she begins a period of self-destruction. York initiates romantic relationships but refuses to commit to the relationship and is unwilling to make compromises.

            "html": "<h2>Days of Being Wild</h2><p>Days of Being Wild is a 1990 Hong Kong drama film directed by Wong Kar-wai. The film stars some of the best-known actors and actresses in Hong Kong, including Leslie Cheung, Andy Lau, Maggie Cheung, Carina Lau, Jacky Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai. Days of Being Wild also marks the first collaboration between Wong and cinematographer Christopher Doyle, with whom he has since made six more films.</p><p>The movie forms the first part of an informal trilogy, together with In the Mood for Love (released in 2000) and 2046 (released in 2004).</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>The movie is set in Hong Kong and the Philippines in 1960\u201361. Yuddy, or 'York' in English (Leslie Cheung), is a playboy in Hong Kong and is well known for stealing girls' hearts and breaking them. His first lover in the film is Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), who suffers emotional and mental depression as a result of Yuddy's wayward attitude. Li-zhen eventually seeks much-needed solace from a sympathetic policeman named Tide (Andy Lau). Their near-romance is often hinted at but never materializes.</p><p>York's next romance is with a vivacious cabaret dancer whose stage name is Mimi (Carina Lau). Mimi is also loved by York's best friend, Zeb (Jacky Cheung). Unsurprisingly, York dumps her too and she begins a period of self-destruction. York initiates romantic relationships but refuses to commit to the relationship and is unwilling to make compromises. He is conflicted about his feelings about his adoptive mother, a former prostitute played by Rebecca Pan, and is obsessed about his biological mother, who he eventually discovers is a Filipino aristocrat.</p><br/><h3>Cast and roles</h3><ul><li>Leslie Cheung as Yuddy (Chinese: \u65ed\u4ed4; Jyutping: Juk1zai2; pinyin: X\u00f9z\u01cei)</li><li>Andy Lau as Tide (Chinese: \u8d85\u4ed4; Jyutping: Ciu1zai2; pinyin: Ch\u0101oz\u01cei), Policeman 6117, who becomes a friend and confidant of Su Li-zhen and later, after the death of his mother, he becomes a sailor and goes to the Philippines</li><li>Maggie Cheung as Su Lizhen (traditional Chinese: \u8607\u9e97\u73cd; simplified Chinese: \u82cf\u4e3d\u73cd; Jyutping: Sou1 Lai6zan1; pinyin: S\u016b L\u00eczh\u0113n), who grew up in Macau and is the ex-girlfriend of Yuddy</li><li>Carina Lau as Leung Fung-ying (traditional Chinese: \u6881\u9cf3\u82f1; simplified Chinese: \u6881\u51e4\u82f1; Jyutping: Loeng4 Fung6jing1; pinyin: Li\u00e1ng F\u00e8ngy\u012bng), Mimi/Lulu (Chinese: \u54aa\u54aa; Jyutping: Mi1mi1; pinyin: M\u012bm\u012b), the girlfriend of Yuddy</li><li>Rebecca Pan as Rebecca, a former prostitute who raises Yuddy, has a love-and-hate relationship with Yuddy, because she refuses to reveal the identity of Yuddy's biological mother</li><li>Jacky Cheung as Zeb (Chinese: \u6b6a\u4ed4; Jyutping: Waai1zai2; pinyin: W\u0101iz\u01cei), Yuddy's friend since childhood; Yuddy used to live above Zeb's family's garage as a kid; Zeb fancies Mimi/Lulu</li><li>Danilo Antunes as Rebecca's lover, who only goes for her money</li><li>Hung Mei-mei as the Amah</li><li>Ling Ling-hung as Nurse</li><li>Tita Mu\u00f1oz as Yuddy's Mother</li><li>Alicia Alonzo as Housekeeper</li><li>Elena Lim So as Hotel Manager</li><li>Maritoni Fernandez as Hotel Maid</li><li>Angela Ponos as Prostitute</li><li>Nonong Talbo as Train Conductor</li><li>Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Gambler (traditional Chinese: \u5468\u6155\u96f2; simplified Chinese: \u5468\u6155\u4e91; Jyutping: Zau1 Mou6wan4; pinyin: Zh\u014du M\u00f9y\u00fan)</li></ul><br/><h3>Music</h3><ul><li>Los Indios Tabajaras, \"Always In My Heart\"</li><li>Xavier Cugat, \"Perfidia\"</li><li>Leslie Cheung performed the song \u4f55\u53bb\u4f55\u5f9e\u4e4b\u963f\u98db\u6b63\u50b3 loosely translated as 'Choice' or 'The True Story of Ah Fei' as the film's theme song and is also found in his album Beloved (\u5bf5\u611b).</li><li>\u6885\u8c54\u82b3 (Anita Mui) \u2013 \u662f\u9019\u6a23\u7684 \u2013 the Cantonese cover of the theme song and is featured at the end of the film during the credits.</li></ul><br/><h3>Box office</h3><p>Days of Being Wild grossed HK $9,751,942 in its Hong Kong run, a number that would become typical for a Wong Kar Wai film.
