The family is still reeling over the recent death of Roger, Alice's husband and the kids' father. At Lina's suggestion, Alice incorporates a Ouija board into her readings. While trying out the board, she unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus that begins to possess Doris. Alice receives a notice that the bank intends to foreclose on their home. Doris contacts the board for help, believing she is communicating with her dead father. The spirit leads her to a secret compartment behind the basement wall containing a pouch of cash. When she gives the money to her mother, the family has an Ouija session, believing they can contact Roger. When the board answers a question only Roger would know the answer to, a thrilled Alice begins believing that they are in contact with her dead husband..",

A widow and her family introduce a Ouija board into their phony seance business, thereby inviting a spirit that possesses the youngest daughter.\r\nOuija: Origin of Evil was released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by Universal Pictures. The film grossed over $81 million worldwide and received positive reviews, with many praising it as a significant improvement over its predecessor.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1967 Los Angeles, a young widow named Alice Zander works out of her suburban home as a spiritual medium, accompanied by her daughters, 15-year-old Paulina \"Lina\" and 9-year-old Doris. The family is still reeling over the recent death of Roger, Alice's husband and the kids' father. At Lina's casual suggestion, Alice incorporates an Ouija board into her readings. While trying out the board, she unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus that begins to possess Doris.\r\nAlice receives a notice that the bank intends to foreclose on their home. Doris contacts the board for help, believing she is communicating with her dead father. The spirit leads her to a secret compartment behind the basement wall containing a pouch of cash. When she gives the money to her mother, the family has a Ouija session, believing they can contact Roger. When the board answers a question only Roger would know the answer to, a thrilled Alice begins believing that they are in contact with her dead husband.\r\nSoon, Doris becomes possessed by a shadowy spirit. Lina, who is becoming disturbed by the changes in her sister, finds papers written by Doris in fluent Polish, a language she does not know, and brings them to Father Tom to translate. Troubled, Father Tom visits them for a Ouija session under the pretense of contacting his dead wife Gloria. Although the session appears to be successful, Father Tom later explains to Alice and Lina that Doris did not contact Gloria. Instead, for every question he asked, she read his thoughts and repeated the answers he was thinking in his mind. He reveals that the pages are entries written by a Polish immigrant named Marcus, who was taken captive during World War II by a sadistic doctor who conducted experiments on him and other captives inside the house's basement. These spirits knew answers that only Roger would know because they have been watching the family since the day they moved in.\r\nMeanwhile, Doris kills Lina's new boyfriend Mikey when he comes to visit. When they find the body, Father Tom, Alice, and Lina burn the Ouija board in the furnace. Father Tom finds the secret room where the experiments were conducted, and is possessed by the spirits. He attacks Alice and Lina, but momentarily seizes clarity, only to be killed by Doris. Alice is captured, while Roger's spirit carries an unconscious Lina to her bed. Recalling an earlier moment when her doll's mouth was stitched by her father's spirit \"to shut out the voices\", Lina realizes she must sew Doris' mouth shut to quiet the spirits' voices and stop the evil. She fights off the embodied evil spirits and sews her mouth shut but kills Doris in the process. The ghost Doris wakes up and Roger appears and Doris is happily reunited with her father. Lina explains to Alice that she had to sew her mouth in order to stop the voices. The spirits then possess Lina and stab Alice with a knife. The spirits unpossess Lina, who is shocked to see what she did. Alice tells Lina that it was not her fault but her own, for getting the board, and also tells Lina that she loves her. Alice then sees Roger and Doris happily together watching them and then dies, leaving Lina in an emotional breakdown.\r\nLina is later on committed in a mental hospital for the suspected murder of her mother and sister. She tells her doctor that she knows she will never be alone again. As Lina is left in a mental hospital room for her, she tears up half of the carpet, showing a floor and makes her own Ouija board, using her blood for the letters, and a piece of lens from a pair of circular glasses to make the Ouija Oracle symbol. Lina uses the makeshift Ouija to summon Doris's spirit, which only succeeds in calling forth Marcus in Doris' form.\r\nIn a post-credits scene, 47 years later, a now elderly and still institutionalized Lina receives a visit from someone claiming to be her niece.\r\nCast\r\nElizabeth Reaser as Alice Zander\r\nAnnalise Basso as Paulina \"Lina\" Zander Lin Shaye as Old Paulina Zander\r\nLin Shaye as Old Paulina Zander\r\nLulu Wilson as Doris Zander\r\nHenry Thomas as Father Tom Hogan\r\nParker Mack as Michael \"Mikey\" Russell\r\nKate Siegel as Jenny Browning\r\nDoug Jones as Ghoul Marcus\r\nHalle Charlton as Ellie\r\nAlexis G.

As a result, Jason Blum wanted to make a film that was significantly different than the original. This appealed to director Mike Flanagan who stated in an interview that he has \"allergy to sequels\" Blum let Flanagan work on the type of horror film he wanted which was a period piece that dealt with a family dynamic. There was some talk from the beginning about whether or not the film should have any connections at all to the original, but Flanagan himself was opposed to this, and instead opted to make references to the original subtle to welcome new viewers while also entertaining fans of the original.\r\nThe 1980 movie The Changeling was an influence on the film. Flanagan screened the earlier film for his director of photography \"like ten times\". He watched such horror classics as The Exorcist and The Watcher in the Woods. It was then that the pair hit off the idea to film the movie as if it were made during the 1970s, using only technology that would only have been available at the time.\r\nProduction in Los Angeles commenced in September 2015 and wrapped in October 2015.

The soundtrack was released by Back Lot Music on October 21, 2016.\r\nRelease\r\nIn April 2015, it was announced that the film would be released on October 21, 2016.\r\nBox office\r\nOuija: Origin of Evil grossed $35.1 million in North America and $46.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $81.7 million, against a budget of $12 million.\r\nThe film opened alongside Boo!

It ended up grossing $14.1 million (compared to its predecessor's $19.9 debut), finishing third at the box office.\r\nCritical response\r\nAccording to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of surveyed critics have given the film a positive review based on 120 reviews, with an average rating of 6.38/10, making it one of the highest-rated films to date produced by either Hasbro Studios or Platinum Dunes. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Ouija: Origin of Evil swerves its franchise's planchette unexpectedly to YES with a surprisingly scary and dramatically satisfying follow-up to its lackluster predecessor.\" At Metacritic, which assigns and normalizes scores of critic reviews, the film holds a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as its predecessor.\r\nKatie Rife for The A.V.
