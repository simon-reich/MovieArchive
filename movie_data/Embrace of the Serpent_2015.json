In 2016 the film was submitted as Colombia's entry for the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards and was included among the final five nominees, becoming the first Colombian film ever to receive a nomination for an Academy Award.\r\nPlot\r\nThe film tells two stories thirty years apart, both featuring Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his tribe. He travels with two scientists, firstly with the German Theo von Martius in 1909 and then with an American named Evan in 1940, to look for the rare yakruna, a sacred plant.\r\nTheo, an ethnographer from T\u00fcbingen who has already been residing in the Amazon for several years, is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local named Manduca whom he had saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation. Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called \"the sun's semen\" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from virola) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money. Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.\r\nMany years later an American botanist, Evan (Brionne Davis), paddles up to a much older Karamakate (Antonio Bol\u00edvar) who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide had sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his chullachaqui, a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free rubber trees, since the United States's supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.\r\nBoth expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a sadistic, lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any \"pagan\" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional Brazilian figure who believes he is the Messiah. He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the Biblical Magi, but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife. By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes.\r\nIn 1909, we are left with Theo, sick and having fled the Mission, arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the Amazon rubber boom, where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men, and cultivated, against local traditions. Karamakate is furious and destroys it. In 1940, Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome-shaped mountains (Cerros de Mavecure), allegedly the home of yakruna. He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant \u2013 he has destroyed all the others \u2013 and prepares it for Evan. The preparation being hallucinogenic, aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience. While most of the film is in black-and-white, a part of this experience is shown in colour to signify its intensity. The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies.\r\nCast\r\nIn Cineaste magazine, the film's writer and director Ciro Guerra noted how the process of finding an actor who can successfully communicate the film's narrative was considered to be a difficult task. After his attempt in reaching out to a variety of indigenous people, it had come to his attention that the older generation were completely detached from the time depicted within the film. Through watching a film over 10 years ago in a workshop with the Ministry of Culture, Guerra was able to find the perfect actor, Nilbio Torres. Torres's two minute presence in the short film had a great impact on Guerra, encouraging him to pursue appointing him the role of Karamakate as \"There was nobody else that could play this guy. He's one of the last Ocaina people remaining. There's only about sixteen of them left.\"\r\nThe chemistry between the two explorers was undoubtedly a perfect fit for the film. Richard Evans Schultes was an admired figure by many, he also had an eerie side to him that Guerra wanted to delve further into. Therefore, by pairing him with Brionne Davis, it highlighted the parallels between the two characters. The two actors spent a lot of time with another during the production of the film the relationship between the two strengthened greatly. Davis's virtuous presentation is made use of and then subverted as a means of playing with the audience's emotions and trust, a key feature prevalent throughout the film.\r\nThe cast are as follows:\r\nNilbio Torres as Young Karamakate\r\nAntonio Bol\u00edvar as Old Karamakate\r\nJan Bijvoet as Theo\r\nBrionne Davis as Evan\r\nLuigi Sciamanna as Gaspar\r\nYauenk\u00fc Migue as Manduca\r\nNicol\u00e1s Cancino as Anizetto\r\nThemes\r\nThe film explores the representation of the first people nations of the Amazon. In the film multiple languages are spoken: Ocaina (which is most frequently spoken), Ticuna, Bora, Andoque, Yucuna (Jukuna), and Muinane. The indigenous peoples are shown to have suffered at the hands of colonizers, and Colombian film critic and author Pedro Adri\u00e1n Zuluaga states that Guerra highlights this by \"shooting peripheric geographies... and bring to the centre of the narrative an unavoidable contradiction between progress and tradition\". Daniela Berghahn, a professor of film studies at the University of London, notes how through time-lapse, Guerra highlights the pillaging of the Amazon rain forest by conquistadors, missionaries and rubber barons, and also the enslavement and degradation of the indigenous peoples, who were converted to Christianity \u2014 the character Manduca is both enslaved and Westernised \u2014 at the cost of their traditions and beliefs. The black and white cinematography bears similarity to the daguerreotype photography of early twentieth century explorers who initially documented the Amazon and inspired the film.\r\nProduction\r\nBefore production started, the director spent two and a half years researching the Colombian Amazon. They discovered a part of the jungle in the north west that had not yet been heavily affected by tourism or commerce and after gaining permission from the local community, they decided on the location. The pre-production and shooting took place over the course of three months with the help of around 40 people from outside the Amazon and 60 people from indigenous communities within the Amazon.

            "html": "<h2>Embrace of the Serpent</h2><p>Embrace of the Serpent (Spanish: El abrazo de la serpiente) is a 2015 Colombian internationally co-produced adventure drama film directed by Ciro Guerra, and written by Guerra and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal. Shot almost entirely in black and white, the film follows two journeys made thirty years apart by the indigenous shaman Karamakate in the Colombian Amazonian jungle, one with Theo, a German ethnographer, and the other with Evan, an American botanist, both of whom are searching for the rare plant yakruna. It was inspired by the travel diaries of Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evans Schultes, and dedicated to lost Amazonian cultures.</p><p>Embrace of the Serpent was premiered on 15 May 2015 during the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Art Cinema Award. The film was released in Colombia on 21 May 2015, and worldwide over the course of the following twelve months. It has received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the cinematography and the story's theme, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and way of life by white colonialism. It has won numerous awards, including the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, the Grand Jury Prize for Best Picture at the 2017 Riviera International Film Festival, and seven awards at the 3rd Platino Awards to recognise the best Ibero-American films of 2015, including the Platino Award for Best Ibero-American Film. In 2016 the film was submitted as Colombia's entry for the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards and was included among the final five nominees, becoming the first Colombian film ever to receive a nomination for an Academy Award.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>The film tells two stories thirty years apart, both featuring Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his tribe. He travels with two scientists, firstly with the German Theo von Martius in 1909 and then with an American named Evan in 1940, to look for the rare yakruna, a sacred plant.</p><p>Theo, an ethnographer from T\u00fcbingen who has already been residing in the Amazon for several years, is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local named Manduca whom he had saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation. Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called \"the sun's semen\" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from virola) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money. Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.</p><p>Many years later an American botanist, Evan (Brionne Davis), paddles up to a much older Karamakate (Antonio Bol\u00edvar) who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide had sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his chullachaqui, a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free rubber trees, since the United States's supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.</p><p>Both expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a sadistic, lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any \"pagan\" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional Brazilian figure who believes he is the Messiah. He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the Biblical Magi, but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife. By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes.</p><p>In 1909, we are left with Theo, sick and having fled the Mission, arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the Amazon rubber boom, where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men, and cultivated, against local traditions. Karamakate is furious and destroys it. In 1940, Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome-shaped mountains (Cerros de Mavecure), allegedly the home of yakruna. He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant \u2013 he has destroyed all the others \u2013 and prepares it for Evan. The preparation being hallucinogenic, aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience. While most of the film is in black-and-white, a part of this experience is shown in colour to signify its intensity. The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><p>In Cineaste magazine, the film's writer and director Ciro Guerra noted how the process of finding an actor who can successfully communicate the film's narrative was considered to be a difficult task. After his attempt in reaching out to a variety of indigenous people, it had come to his attention that the older generation were completely detached from the time depicted within the film. Through watching a film over 10 years ago in a workshop with the Ministry of Culture, Guerra was able to find the perfect actor, Nilbio Torres. Torres's two minute presence in the short film had a great impact on Guerra, encouraging him to pursue appointing him the role of Karamakate as \"There was nobody else that could play this guy. He's one of the last Ocaina people remaining. There's only about sixteen of them left.\"</p><p>The chemistry between the two explorers was undoubtedly a perfect fit for the film. Richard Evans Schultes was an admired figure by many, he also had an eerie side to him that Guerra wanted to delve further into. Therefore, by pairing him with Brionne Davis, it highlighted the parallels between the two characters. The two actors spent a lot of time with another during the production of the film the relationship between the two strengthened greatly. Davis's virtuous presentation is made use of and then subverted as a means of playing with the audience's emotions and trust, a key feature prevalent throughout the film.</p><p>The cast are as follows:</p><ul><li>Nilbio Torres as Young Karamakate</li><li>Antonio Bol\u00edvar as Old Karamakate</li><li>Jan Bijvoet as Theo</li><li>Brionne Davis as Evan</li><li>Luigi Sciamanna as Gaspar</li><li>Yauenk\u00fc Migue as Manduca</li><li>Nicol\u00e1s Cancino as Anizetto</li></ul><br/><h3>Themes</h3><p>The film explores the representation of the first people nations of the Amazon. In the film multiple languages are spoken: Ocaina (which is most frequently spoken), Ticuna, Bora, Andoque, Yucuna (Jukuna), and Muinane. The indigenous peoples are shown to have suffered at the hands of colonizers, and Colombian film critic and author Pedro Adri\u00e1n Zuluaga states that Guerra highlights this by \"shooting peripheric geographies... and bring to the centre of the narrative an unavoidable contradiction between progress and tradition\". Daniela Berghahn, a professor of film studies at the University of London, notes how through time-lapse, Guerra highlights the pillaging of the Amazon rain forest by conquistadors, missionaries and rubber barons, and also the enslavement and degradation of the indigenous peoples, who were converted to Christianity \u2014 the character Manduca is both enslaved and Westernised \u2014 at the cost of their traditions and beliefs. The black and white cinematography bears similarity to the daguerreotype photography of early twentieth century explorers who initially documented the Amazon and inspired the film.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>Before production started, the director spent two and a half years researching the Colombian Amazon. They discovered a part of the jungle in the north west that had not yet been heavily affected by tourism or commerce and after gaining permission from the local community, they decided on the location. The pre-production and shooting took place over the course of three months with the help of around 40 people from outside the Amazon and 60 people from indigenous communities within the Amazon. The director extensively collaborated with the community and invited them to participate and collaborate both in front and behind the camera. To avoid any problems caused by the harsh environment, the indigenous people taught the crew how to work with the jungle and performed rituals for spiritual protection. Because of this, there were no accidents or illnesses and the shooting ran smoothly. Additionally, Guerra let the indigenous people translate the script, during which they redrafted parts to make it more accurate.</p><p>Embrace of the Serpent was filmed in the Amazon\u00eda region of Colombia.
