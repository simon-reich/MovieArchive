    "plot": "This film focuses on ex-Foreign Legion officer, Galoup, as he recalls his once glorious life, leading troops in the Gulf of Djibouti. His existence there was happy, strict and regimented, but the arrival of a promising young recruit, Sentain, plants the seeds of jealousy in Galoup's mind. He feels compelled to stop him from coming to the attention of the commandant who he admires, but who ignores him. Ultimately, his jealousy leads to the destruction of both Sentain and himself.",

The story is set in Djibouti, where the protagonists are soldiers in the French Foreign Legion. Parts of the soundtrack of the movie are from Benjamin Britten's opera based on the novella.\r\nPlot summary\r\nThe film begins with the silhouettes of soldiers being ordered to stand in the sun as an endurance test. It is a recollection of Chief Adjutant Galoup (Denis Lavant), from his home in Marseille, where he is writing his memoirs. He remembers the heat of Djibouti, where he led his section of men under the command of Commandant Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor). We see numerous training scenes, including assault courses and the securing of buildings. Much of the reminiscences has a balletic quality. This is set against a back-drop of the traditional Djibouti life of local people. Galoup has a beautiful young local girlfriend and they often go out dancing.\r\nGaloup says of Forestier: I admired him without knowing why. He retains a wristband with the word Bruno. Galoup envies many things in Forestier, including his clear affection from the men. However, they happily socialise together, playing chess and snooker.\r\nOne day, his section is joined by Gilles Sentain (Gr\u00e9goire Colin), whose physical beauty, social skills, and fortitude make Galoup envious. Repressed homosexual feelings from Galoup are suggested. He swears to destroy Sentain.\r\nWhen Sentain hands a canteen of water to another soldier who is being punished by being ordered to dig a large hole in the heat of the day, Galoup chastises Sentain and knocks the water from his hand. Sentain strikes Galoup. He punishes Sentain by taking him out into the desert and making him walk back to the base. But Sentain does not return because Galoup has tampered with his compass, and the soldier consequently becomes lost. When Sentain fails to return, he is assumed to have deserted.\r\nSentain collapses in the arid salt flats. His salt-encrusted compass is spotted by fellow legionnaires at a sale of local salt-encrusted novelties and is believed to prove Sentain is dead. However, Sentain is found by local tribespeople who place him on a bus where he is looked after.\r\nHowever, on the assumption that Galoup has either killed or tried to kill Sentain, Galoup is sent back to France by his commander for a court martial. It ends his career in the Foreign Legion, his only real love. We see him immaculately make his bed in the military manner, then lie on top clutching a pistol. The final scene is a lively acrobatic solo dance to \"The Rhythm of the Night\" at a night club in Djibouti.\r\nCast\r\nDenis Lavant - Sergent Galoup\r\nMichel Subor - Commandant Bruno Forestier\r\nGr\u00e9goire Colin - Gilles Sentain\r\nRichard Courcet - Legionnaire\r\nNicolas Duvauchelle - Legionnaire\r\nProduction\r\nIn an interview, Denis said, \"One of the cast had actually been in the Legion, so we took all their real exercises and did them together every day, to concentrate the actors as a group. We never said we were going to choreograph the film. But afterwards, when we started shooting, using Britten's music, those exercises became like a dance.\"\r\nReception\r\nThe film was highly acclaimed in the United States, topping the Village Voice's Film Critics' Poll in 2000, with Claire Denis also placing at #2 for best director. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader rated it a \"masterpiece,\" giving it the paper's highest rating of four stars. Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote that \"Beau Travail is the most extreme example of talent, baffling and exhilarating. I don't know when I've seen a movie that is in so many ways foreign to what draws me to movies and still felt under a spell.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it the magazine's highest rating, calling it \"unique and unforgettable.\" J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that the film is \"so tactile in its cinematography, inventive in its camera placement, and sensuous in its editing that the purposefully oblique and languid narrative is all but eclipsed.\"\r\nThe review aggregator website, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 91/100 based on 20 reviews, which they characterized as \"universal acclaim.\" Rotten Tomatoes, another aggregator, reports an 81% approval rating based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.65/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Beau Travail finds director Claire Denis drawing on classic literature to construct a modern tragedy fueled by timeless desires\".",
