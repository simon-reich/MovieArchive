    "plot": "It's 1949 Los Angeles, and gangster Mickey Cohen has moved in, with the intention of controlling all criminal activity in the city. He has bought local judges and police, and no one is willing to cross him or testify against him. Everyone except Sergeant John O'Mara, a former World War II soldier, whose goal is to settle with his family in a peaceful Los Angeles. Police Chief William Parker decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen, and chooses O'Mara to lead the unit. O'Mara chooses 4 cops and asks another cop and vet, Jerry Wooters to join him but Wooters is not interested. But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organization. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it's the cops.",

The LAPD has not been able to stop Cohen's ruthless rise, as he has eliminated witnesses and bribed both the court and the police.\r\nDetermined to put a stop to Cohen, LAPD Chief Bill Parker creates a secret police unit with the sole mission of bringing Cohen to justice. Parker puts a trusted friend, Sgt. John O'Mara, in charge of secretly building the unit. With the help of his wife, Connie, he recruits Sgt. Jerry Wooters and four un-corruptible misfit officers \u2013 black Lieutenant Coleman Harris, electronics expert and family man Conwell Keeler, sharpshooter Max Kennard and his Hispanic prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Navidad Ramirez. Calling themselves the \"Gangster Squad\", they begin the task of destroying Cohen's operations.\r\nThe Squad's plans go well, striking several successful blows at the heart of Cohen's criminal organization, even shutting down his ultra-lucrative wire gambling business. Cohen, not knowing the Squad is LAPD, believes someone has betrayed him to rivals and strikes out at those around him, including his girlfriend Grace Faraday. Wooters has also been seeing Faraday and tries to help her escape from Cohen, enlisting the help of mutual friend Jack Whalen.\r\nRealizing the attackers have never stolen his money, Cohen deduces they are cops and will have bugged his house. He uses it to lure the Squad into a trap in Chinatown, while Keeler is killed at the Squads' operation base. When Faraday later witnesses Cohen murder Whalen, she agrees to testify against Cohen. O'Mara forces a crooked judge to do his duty and sign an arrest warrant. The Squad then goes over to the Park Plaza Hotel to arrest Cohen.\r\nCohen and his men engage in a gun battle with the Squad, with Wooters and Kennard being wounded in the process. Cohen and bodyguard Karl Lennox escape, but O'Mara rams their vehicle into a fountain. Navidad helps a dying Kennard shoot Lennox, who was about to shoot O'Mara. Cohen and O'Mara fight each other in a brutal bare-knuckle fight, while a crowd of onlookers and journalists gather. O'Mara finally beats Cohen and has him arrested, ending his spread of the mafia into the Los Angeles area. The Gangster Squad is never mentioned for their role, and their surviving members remain a secret. Cohen is sentenced to life imprisonment, and is greeted with a beating by inmates who were friends of Jack Whalen. Wooters and Faraday get married, and O'Mara quits his job with the LAPD to live a quiet life with his wife and son.\r\nCast\r\nJosh Brolin as Sergeant John O'Mara. O'Mara is a World War II veteran. He is honest, hardworking, and a no nonsense man. He is a decorated war hero, having earned the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts. He is believed to have been a part of the OSS as his Army record is partially classified.\r\nRyan Gosling as Sergeant Jerry Wooters. Wooters is an easy going playboy. He is a cop who enjoys his job and stays in his lane. He too is a World War II veteran, having served in the Pacific.\r\nSean Penn as Mickey Cohen. Mickey is a ruthless sadist. He will grow his empire at any cost, killing anyone who fails him or opposes him.\r\nNick Nolte as Chief Bill Parker\r\nEmma Stone as Grace Faraday. Faraday is Cohen's social etiquette teacher and quasi lover. She is soft-spoken but has a heart for Wooters over Cohen.\r\nAnthony Mackie as Lieutenant Coleman Harris\r\nGiovanni Ribisi as Officer Conwell Keeler\r\nRobert Patrick as Officer Max Kennard\r\nMichael Pe\u00f1a as Officer Navidad Ramirez\r\nMireille Enos as Connie O'Mara\r\nTroy Garity as One-Eyed Assassin - Wrevock\r\nHolt McCallany as Karl Lennox\r\nSullivan Stapleton as Jack Whalen\r\nJames Carpinello as Johnny Stompanato\r\nJames H\u00e9bert as Mitch Racine\r\nEvan Jones as Neddy Herbert\r\nJosh Pence as Officer Daryl Gates\r\nJohn Aylward as Judge Carter\r\nJack Conley as Sheriff Biscailuz\r\nJack McGee as Lt. Quincannon\r\nJon Polito as Jack Dragna\r\nWade Williams as Rourke\r\nAmbyr Childers as Milk skinned blonde\r\nMick Betancourt as Detective Sgt. Will Hendricks\r\nMac Brandt as Bruiser\r\nBrandon Molale as Jimmy 'Bockscar' Knox\r\nMichael Papajohn as Mike 'The Flea'\r\nJeff Wolfe as Giovanni Vacarezza\r\nAnthony Molinari as Lorenzo Molinari\r\nAustin Highsmith as Patty\r\nNeil Koppel as Max Solomon\r\nAustin Abrams as Pete\r\nLucy Davenport as Slapsy Maxie's singer\r\nDennis Cockrum as Elmer Jackson\r\nHaley Strode as Keeler's wife, Maria\r\nMaxwell Perry Cotton as Keeler's son, Charlie\r\nFrank Grillo as Jimmy Reagan\r\nLucy Walsh as Manicurist\r\nProduction\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began on September 6, 2011 in Los Angeles. Sets were located all over L.A. County from north of the San Fernando Valley to south of the county border. Sets were also recreated in Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. Filming wrapped on December 15, 2011.\r\nAssociation with the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting\r\nThe first trailer for Gangster Squad was released on May 9, 2012. In the wake of the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, the trailer was pulled from running before films and airing on television, and removed from Apple's trailer site and YouTube due to a scene in which characters shoot submachine guns at moviegoers through the screen of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\r\nIt was later reported that the theater scene from the film would be either removed or placed in a different setting, since it is a crucial part of the film, and the film would undergo additional re-shoots of several scenes to accommodate these changes, which resulted in the release of Gangster Squad being moved back to a later date. About a week after the shootings in Aurora, Warner officially confirmed that the film would be released on January 11, 2013, bumped from the original September 7, 2012 release date. Just two weeks later, on August 22, the cast reunited in Los Angeles to completely re-shoot the main action sequence of the film. The new scene was placed in a version of Chinatown where the Gangster Squad comes into open conflict with the gangsters as they strike back at the Gangster Squad. Josh Brolin said he was not sad the original scene was cut and admitted that this new version is just as violent.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film was originally supposed to be theatrically released in the United States on September 7, 2012. However in the wake of the Aurora shooting and the need to accompany for reshoots, it was pushed back to January 11, 2013.\r\nHome media\r\nGangster Squad was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 23, 2013. The Blu-ray includes director's commentary from Ruben Fleischer and several segments about the real life men and stories of the Gangster Squad and Mickey Cohen. As of June 2013, it had made $9.6 million from DVD sales and $6.7 million from Blu-ray, for a total of $16.3 million in sales.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nGangster Squad grossed $46 million in the United States and Canada, and $59.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $105.2 million, against a production budget of $60 million.\r\nThe film grossed $17.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office behind Zero Dark Thirty and A Haunted House. It then made $8.6 million in its second weekend (including $10.1 million over the four-day MLK weekend) and $4.3 million in its third weekend.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 32% based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though it's stylish and features a talented cast, Gangster Squad suffers from lackluster writing, underdeveloped characters, and an excessive amount of violence.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nThe reviewers of Spill.com gave it a \"Rental,\" praising the stylish approach but criticizing the dialogue, Emma Stone's under-developed \"damsel-in-distress\" character, and Sean Penn's laughable makeup. IGN editor Chris Tilly wrote \"Gangster Squad looks great but frustrates because with the talent involved, it had the potential to be so much more\" and rated the film 6.3/10. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, saying \"Gangster Squad is a highly stylized, pulp-fiction period piece based on true events\" and noted the strong performances.\r\nWriting in place of Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, Jeff Shannon gave the film 2 stars out of 4, saying that Fleischer, better known for his comedic work, was \"out of his element, and barely suppressing his urge to spoof the genre\". He further criticized the stock characters, and the generally uneven tone of the film, but praised the action highlights such as the car chase, and occasional flashes of brilliance in the performance of Sean Penn.\r\nHistorical accuracy\r\nThe film is inspired by the real-life Gangster Squad of the LAPD, although much of the film is fabricated.\r\nThe film portrays Cohen organizing the murder of his overseer Jack Dragna, whereas in reality Cohen and Dragna were equals and Dragna died of a heart attack in 1956.\r\nWilliam Parker was only 45 years old in 1949, and not in his 70s like Nick Nolte (Parker did not live to become 70; he died at age 61), and was not the one who created the Gangster Squad. The Squad was created by Chief Clemence B. Horrall in 1946, and was in an effort to save the image of the city, not the actual city itself.\r\nThe film concludes with Cohen being arrested in 1949 for murder and sent to Alcatraz. In reality, he was imprisoned in 1951 and again in 1961 for tax evasion. He was, however, attacked with a lead pipe while in prison as mentioned.\r\nWhile Anthony Mackie and Michael Pe\u00f1a are members of the Squad in the film, the real life group had no African-American or Hispanics as part of it.\r\nWhile it is possible Cohen murdered Jack Whalen in real life, it was not at Whalen's home as depicted in the film. Whalen was shot in 1959 while at dinner with Cohen and three of his associates, although Cohen was not accused or convicted of the murder himself.\r\nCohen's bodyguard Johnny Stompanato was not shot like depicted in the film, but instead lived until 1958, when he was stabbed by Cheryl Crane, the daughter of his girlfriend, Lana Turner.\r\nThe character Max Kennard was based on real life lawman Doug (Jumbo) Kennard, who was killed in a 1952 drunk car crash after he had retired, and not shot in the line of duty like in the film.\r\nIn the film, Conwell Keeler is the first member of the Squad to be killed. In real life, he outlived all other members of the Gangster Squad, dying of a stroke in 2012.",
