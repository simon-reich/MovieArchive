The experiences continue to intensify, and they begin to be physically beaten by their visions as they try and go deeper into the death experience to find a cure.",

It grossed $61 million at the box office.\r\nA follow-up directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev was released in September 2017, also featuring Kiefer Sutherland in a starring role.\r\nPlot\r\nNelson Wright, a medical student, walks onto a beach one day and proclaims \u201ctoday is a good day to die\u201d. He later convinces four of his medical school classmates\u2014Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Randy Steckle, and Rachel Manus\u2014to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While \"dead\", he experiences a sort of afterlife. He sees a vision of a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson's daring feat.\r\nJoe flatlines next, and he experiences an erotic afterlife sequence. He agrees with Nelson's claim that something indeed exists. David is third to flatline, and he sees a vision of a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school. The three men start to experience hallucinations related to their afterlife visions. Nelson gets physically beat up by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by his home videos of his sexual dalliances with other women. David finds Winnie Hicks on a train, and she verbally taunts him the way he taunted her.\r\nRachel decides to flatline next on Halloween. David tries to stop the others from giving Rachel their same fate, but she is already \"dead\" when he arrives. Rachel nearly dies for good after the power goes out, and the men are unable to shock her with the defibrillator paddles. Luckily, she survives, but she, too, is haunted by the memory of her father committing suicide when she was young.\r\nThe three men finally reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe's fianc\u00e9e, Anne, comes to his apartment, and she breaks up with him after she discovers his videos. Joe's visions cease after Anne leaves him.\r\nDavid goes to visit Winnie Hicks, now grown up, and apologizes to her. Winnie accepts his apology and thanks him. David immediately feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. Then, David finds Nelson, who accompanied David to visit Winnie, beating himself with a climbing axe. In Nelson's mind, however, Billy Mahoney is attempting for a third time to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town.\r\nRachel seeks comfort in the arms of David, and the two spend the night together. While Rachel and David are together, Nelson takes Steckle and Joe to a graveyard. He reveals that he killed Billy Mahoney as a kid by throwing rocks at him until he fell out of a tree. Nelson storms off, leaving Joe and Steckle stranded.\r\nDavid leaves Rachel alone in order to rescue Joe and Steckle at the cemetery. While alone, Rachel goes to the bathroom, and finds her father. He apologizes to his daughter, and her guilt over his death is lifted when she discovers that he was addicted to heroin. Then, Nelson calls Rachel, and he tells her that he needs to flatline again in order to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his stupid plan.\r\nThe three men race to Nelson, who has been dead for an estimated nine minutes already. Rachel soon finds them, and the four friends work feverishly to save Nelson. In the afterlife, Nelson is experiencing himself as a young boy being stoned by Billy Mahoney from the tree. Nelson dies in the afterlife from the fall, and his friends cannot revive him. When they are about to give up, Mahoney forgives Nelson, and David gives Nelson one last shock. This brings him back, and Nelson tells them, \"It wasn't such a good day to die.\"\r\nCast\r\nKiefer Sutherland as Nelson Wright\r\nJulia Roberts as Rachel Manus\r\nKevin Bacon as David Labraccio\r\nWilliam Baldwin as Joe Hurley\r\nOliver Platt as Randy Steckle\r\nKimberly Scott as Winnie Hicks\r\nJoshua Rudoy as Billy Mahoney\r\nBenjamin Mouton as Mr. Manus\r\nHope Davis as Anne Coldren\r\nPatricia Belcher as Edna\r\nBeth Grant as Housewife\r\nRelease\r\nColumbia Pictures released Flatliners theatrically on August 10, 1990. The film debuted at No.1 and took in $10 million on its opening weekend. It grossed $61.5 million total in the United States.\r\nReception\r\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 48% of critics give the film a positive review based on 44 reviews, with the critical consensus \"While it boasts an impressive cast, striking visuals, and an effective mood, Flatliners never quite jolts its story to life.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score 55 out of 100, based 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nIn her review for The New York Times, Caryn James wrote, \"when taken on its own stylish terms, Flatliners is greatly entertaining. Viewers are likely to go along with this film instantly or else ridicule it to death. Its atmospheric approach doesn't admit much middle ground.\" Critic Roger Ebert praised the film as \"an original, intelligent thriller, well-directed by Joel Schumacher\" and called the cast \"talented young actors, inhabit the shadows with the right mixture of intensity, fear and cockiness\". But Ebert criticized Flatliners for \"plot manipulation that is unworthy of the brilliance of its theme. I only wish it had been restructured so we didn't need to go through the same crisis so many times.\" Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine praised the film's young stars, but complained that \"by dodging the questions it raises about life after death, Flatliners ends up tripping on timidity. It's a movie about daring that dares nothing.\"\r\nEntertainment Weekly gave the film a \"D\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"What isn't in evidence is the sort of overheated lunacy that made the William Hurt speed-freak trip movie Altered States (1980) such delectable trash. Flatliners is camp, but of a very low order. Schumacher is too intent on pandering to the youth market to take the mad risks and plunges that make for a scintillating bad movie.\" In contrast, The Washington Post's Rita Kempley loved the film, calling it: \"a heart-stopping, breathtakingly sumptuous haunted house of a movie\". The film has become a cult film.\r\nSoundtrack\r\n\"Party Town\" \u2013 Written and performed by Dave Stewart and the Spiritual Cowboys\r\n\"The Clapping Song\" \u2013 Written by Lincoln Chase\r\nFollow-up\r\nOn October 5, 2015, a follow-up starring Ellen Page and Diego Luna was announced, following the casting of Nina Dobrev, James Norton and Kiersey Clemons. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in the remake. Sutherland had originally announced that he was reprising his role as Nelson Wright, revealing that the new film would actually be a sequel rather than a remake. However, upon release, Sutherland's character is identified as Barry Wolfson; a deleted scene indicates Sutherland is in fact playing the same character, living under a new identity. Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev, it was released on September 29, 2017.",

Its atmospheric approach doesn't admit much middle ground.\" Critic Roger Ebert praised the film as \"an original, intelligent thriller, well-directed by Joel Schumacher\" and called the cast \"talented young actors, inhabit the shadows with the right mixture of intensity, fear and cockiness\". But Ebert criticized Flatliners for \"plot manipulation that is unworthy of the brilliance of its theme. I only wish it had been restructured so we didn't need to go through the same crisis so many times.\" Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine praised the film's young stars, but complained that \"by dodging the questions it raises about life after death, Flatliners ends up tripping on timidity. It's a movie about daring that dares nothing.\"</p><p>Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"D\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"What isn't in evidence is the sort of overheated lunacy that made the William Hurt speed-freak trip movie Altered States (1980) such delectable trash. Flatliners is camp, but of a very low order. Schumacher is too intent on pandering to the youth market to take the mad risks and plunges that make for a scintillating bad movie.\" In contrast, The Washington Post's Rita Kempley loved the film, calling it: \"a heart-stopping, breathtakingly sumptuous haunted house of a movie\". The film has become a cult film.</p><br/><h3>Soundtrack</h3><ul><li>\"Party Town\" \u2013 Written and performed by Dave Stewart and the Spiritual Cowboys</li><li>\"The Clapping Song\" \u2013 Written by Lincoln Chase</li></ul><br/><h3>Follow-up</h3><p>On October 5, 2015, a follow-up starring Ellen Page and Diego Luna was announced, following the casting of Nina Dobrev, James Norton and Kiersey Clemons. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in the remake. Sutherland had originally announced that he was reprising his role as Nelson Wright, revealing that the new film would actually be a sequel rather than a remake. However, upon release, Sutherland's character is identified as Barry Wolfson; a deleted scene indicates Sutherland is in fact playing the same character, living under a new identity. Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev, it was released on September 29, 2017.</p><br/>"
