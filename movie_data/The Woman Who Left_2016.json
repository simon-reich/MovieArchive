Although Somorostro reunites with her daughter, she learns that her husband is now deceased and her son is missing. She realized that a thing remains unchanged - the power and privilege of the elite. This belief is cemented when Somorostro later found out that her former rich lover, Rodrigo Trinidad (Michael de Mesa) was the one who framed her for a crime.

According to Diaz, the film was inspired by the short story \"God Sees the Truth, But Waits\" by Leo Tolstoy. Diaz, reflecting on the story and how it relates to his work, said that life is not truly understood by anyone and that more often people \"abide and succumb to life's randomness.\" Charo Santos-Concio, the lead actress described the film as \"a story of forgiveness, of transcendence.\"\r\nRelease\r\nWhile the film was not made for a particular film festival, director Diaz is open to the idea of screening The Woman Who Left in film festivals.
