    "plot": "THE NIGHTINGALE is a meditation on the horrors of Australian colonization, set at the turn of the 19th century. The film follows Clare, a 21-year-old native Irish wife and mother held captive beyond her 7-year sentence, desperate to be free of her obsessed master, British lieutenant Hawkins. Clare's husband Aidan intervenes with devastating consequences for all. When British authorities fail to deliver justice, Clare pursues Hawkins, who leaves his post suddenly to secure a captaincy up north. Unfamiliar with the Tasmanian wilderness she enlists the help of an orphaned Aboriginal tracker Billy. Marked by their traumas, the two fight to overcome their distrust and prejudices against the backdrop of Australia's infamous 'Black War'.",

Clare dodges them, then asks about the overdue letter of recommendation that would allow her family\u2014husband Aidan and their infant daughter\u2014freedom.

Later that night, Aidan suspects that Clare has been hurt but promises to remain calm when he confronts Hawkins the following morning about the letter; however, he fails to sway him.\r\nThat night, a drunken Aidan engages in a brawl with Hawkins, Ruse and wide-eyed Private Jago. The visiting officer witnesses the entire incident and determines that this, along with other acts of poor conduct displayed by Hawkins and his soldiers, make him unfit for promotion. Incensed, Hawkins commands Ruse and Jago to gather supplies for an impromptu journey through treacherous bush to the town of Launceston in hopes of securing his promotion. Before departing, the soldiers intercept the Carroll family, who are attempting to flee. Hawkins taunts Aidan about the \u201cnumerous\u201d times he's had sex with Clare. Then he and Ruse gang rape Clare, Hawkins kills Aidan, and Jago kills their baby and knocks Clare unconscious.\r\nAfter Clare reports the incident to a dubious RMP official the following morning, she decides to seek revenge herself, with the help of an Aboriginal tracker named Billy. Clare presents the mission to Billy as her desire to rendezvous with her soldier husband on his journey. At first, Clare is domineering toward Billy, but their mutual hostility dissipates and they gradually bond as they learn about each other's tragic upbringings and their shared hatred of the British. Billy tells Clare that his actual name is Mangana, Palawa kani for \u201cblackbird\u201d, and that he wishes to go up north to reunite with the still-living female members of his people. Meanwhile, the officers recruit three convicts and Aboriginal Charlie for their journey. Hawkins takes a liking to one of the convicts, a child named Eddie, and Ruse kidnaps a woman named Lowanna to be used as a sex slave. Aboriginal men kill one of the convicts and injure Jago in an unsuccessful rescue mission. Facing the men, Hawkins holds Lowanna hostage, then kills her in cold blood distracting the men. He, Ruse, and the convicts flee, leaving Jago behind. Later, when Clare and Billy stumble upon Jago, whom Billy assumes is her husband, Clare corners Jago and repeatedly stabs and beats him to death. Billy considers abandoning a now-desperate Clare, but after he learns the true story behind her desire to get revenge on the soldiers, he decides to stay.\r\nCharlie, as revenge for the soldiers' inhumanity, diverts the journey to a dead end on the summit of a mountain. Ruse kills him, but Hawkins chastises Ruse for the rash decision and forces him to be their guide on the way back down the mountain. After Clare and Billy find Charlie's body, Billy performs burial rites and informs Clare that now he, too, seeks vengeance. The two finally approach the group of four men, but Clare freezes when she sees Hawkins, allowing him to graze her with a musket shot, forcing Clare and Billy to split up. Billy is found and forced to be the new guide. He brings the soldiers back to the main path to Launceston, and Hawkins orders Eddie to kill Billy, but Eddie hesitates, allowing Billy to escape. Hawkins tries to abandon Eddie, but when Eddie begs for a second chance, Hawkins shoots and kills him. Clare also finds her way back onto the main path and reunites with Billy. While on their way, they encounter a chain gang of Aboriginal men, one of whom informs Billy that he is now the last of his people. When the prisoner yells at his captors about their callousness, they shoot him and the others dead.\r\nIn Launceston, Clare valiantly confronts a newly promoted Hawkins about his war crimes in the presence of several British officers while Billy watches in hiding. The two then flee town for the night, but Billy dons war paint, enters the hostel where Hawkins and Ruse are lodged, and kills them both, but not before Ruse wounds Billy.

Kent defended the decision to show such violence, saying that the film contains historically accurate depictions of the violence and racism that colonial power inflicted on the indigenous Australian people of that time. The film was produced in collaboration with Tasmanian Aboriginal elders who asserted that this is an honest and necessary depiction of their history and a story that needs to be told. Kent said she understands the negative reactions, but stated that she remains enormously proud of the film and stressed to audiences that this film is about a need for love, compassion and kindness in dark times.\r\nAccolades",
