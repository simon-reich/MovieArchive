Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the structure, humor, and characters of the film, though there was criticism that the director had not been sufficiently adventurous.\r\nPlot\r\nThe film consists of three stories that take place on the same night in downtown Memphis. The three stories are linked together by the Arcade Hotel, a run-down flophouse presided over by a night clerk (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and a bellboy (Cinqu\u00e9 Lee), where the principal characters in each story spend a part of the night. Every room in the hotel lacks a television (as is noted in each story) but is adorned with a portrait of Elvis Presley.\r\nThe first story, \"Far from Yokohama\", features Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) and Jun (Masatoshi Nagase), a teenage couple from Yokohama making a pilgrimage to Memphis during a trip across America. Mitsuko is obsessed with Elvis, and has put together a scrapbook detailing her belief that the singer has a mystical connection to other cultural figures ranging from Madonna to the Buddha to the Statue of Liberty. The story follows the couple as they travel from the train station, through downtown Memphis and a tour of Sun Records, to the Arcade hotel, before they eventually depart to board the train again.\r\nThe second story, \"A Ghost\", is about an Italian widow, Luisa (Nicoletta Braschi), who is stranded in Memphis while escorting her husband's coffin back to Italy. Luisa, after being conned twice, is forced to share a room at the hotel with Dee Dee (Elizabeth Bracco), a young woman who has just left her British boyfriend (Johnny from the final story) and plans to leave the city in the morning. Luisa is kept awake by Dee Dee's constant talking. After Dee Dee finally goes to sleep, Luisa is visited by an apparition of Elvis Presley.\r\nThe final story, \"Lost in Space\", introduces Johnny (Joe Strummer). Upset after losing his job and his girlfriend (Dee Dee), Johnny \u2013 called Elvis, much to his chagrin \u2013 drunkenly brandishes a gun in a bar before leaving with his friend Will Robinson (Rick Aviles) and his ex-girlfriend's brother, Charlie (Steve Buscemi), who believes Johnny to be his brother-in-law. They stop at a liquor store, which Johnny robs, shooting its clerk (Rockets Redglare) in the process. Fearing the consequences, Johnny, Will and Charlie retire to the hotel to hide out for the night; there, they all become increasingly intoxicated. Charlie realizes that Will shares the same name as the character Will Robinson from the television show Lost in Space, which Johnny has never heard of. Charlie and Johnny proceed to tell him about the show, and Will comments that the title describes how he feels then with Charlie and Johnny: lost in space. The next morning, Charlie discovers that Johnny isn't really his brother-in-law, which angers him because of what they've been through. Johnny attempts to shoot himself, and while struggling to prevent him, Charlie is accidentally shot in the leg. Leaving the hotel, the three rush to escape a police car that isn't even looking for them. The closing credits show the train, the airport and final views of the characters from the first two stories.\r\nCast\r\nMasatoshi Nagase as Jun\r\nYouki Kudoh as Mitsuko\r\nScreamin' Jay Hawkins as Night Clerk\r\nCinqu\u00e9 Lee as Bellboy\r\nRufus Thomas as Man in Station\r\nJodie Markell as Sun Studio Guide\r\nNicoletta Braschi as Luisa\r\nElizabeth Bracco as Dee Dee, Charlie's Sister\r\nSy Richardson as Newsvendor\r\nTom Noonan as Man in Arcade Diner\r\nJoe Strummer as Johnny aka Elvis\r\nRick Aviles as Will Robinson\r\nSteve Buscemi as Charlie the Barber\r\nVondie Curtis-Hall as Ed\r\nTom Waits as Radio D.J. (voice)\r\nProduction\r\nScript and casting\r\nJarmusch wrote the script for the film under the working title \"One Night in Memphis\", without ever having been to the southern city. The idea for \"Far from Yokohama\", the first segment, he took from a one-act play he had been writing before filming Down by Law (1986). The play \u2013 unrelated to Elvis or Memphis \u2013 concerned a constantly argumentative young couple, one of whom gradually comes to realize that their fighting is a unifying force in the relationship. The interconnected stories were inspired by Jarmusch's dwelling on literary forms, and specifically the work of Chaucer, Italian episodic films and Japanese ghost story cinema. As with his other films, Jarmusch's starting point for writing Mystery Train was the actors and characters he had foremost in mind. The great number of these collaborators contributed to it being \"the most complicated film to write and execute\" according to the director.\r\n\u2014Jim Jarmusch, Interview, November 1989.\r\nThe role of Johnny was written by Jarmusch specifically for Joe Strummer, who had been the frontman of The Clash, the director's favorite 1980s rock band. Jarmusch had conceived the part a few years previously while the two were together in Spain, and although the musician had been in a period of depression at the time following the collapse of the band, he was drawn by the Memphis setting of the film. Unlike the jovial Steve Buscemi, Strummer did not stay on set to joke with the veteran actors between shots, but instead preferred to keep his own company, focusing intensively on orienting himself to the role.\r\nJarmusch had met blues singer Screamin' Jay Hawkins after featuring his music prominently in his breakthrough feature Stranger Than Paradise (1984). Although reticent about acting, Hawkins responded favorably to the director's offer to appear. The part of Luisa was also written by the director with the star \u2013 actress Nicoletta Braschi \u2013 in mind; the two had previously collaborated on Down by Law (1986). Cinqu\u00e9 Lee is the younger brother of director Spike Lee, a longtime friend of Jarmusch from their days at New York University's film school, while Youki Kudoh was cast after the director saw her performance in S\u014dgo Ishii's The Crazy Family (1984) while promoting Down by Law in Japan. Repeat Jarmusch collaborators who worked on the film included John Lurie who provided the original music, cinematographer Robby M\u00fcller, and singer Tom Waits, who in a voice appearance reprised his role of radio DJ Lee Baby Sims from Down by Law. Other cameos include Jarmusch's long-time girlfriend Sara Driver as an airport clerk, Rufus Thomas as the man in the train station who greets the Japanese couple, Rockets Redglare as the clerk of the liquor store, Vondie Curtis-Hall as Ed, Sy Richardson as the news vendor, and Richard Boes and Tom Noonan as diner patrons.\r\nFilming\r\nMystery Train was filmed in Memphis in the summer of 1988. After arriving in the city during a snowstorm to scout for shooting locations, Jarmusch drove around without direction before coming to the intersection of a disused train station, the Arcade Luncheonette diner, and the dilapidated Arcade Hotel that would become the film's core setting. He would later recount the experience in a March 1990 interview in Spin: \"Man, ... this crossroad is filled with so many ghosts. You know Robert Johnson walked down that street, you know Muddy Waters was in that train station.\" The locale of the intersection was one of the film's primary formal elements; the effect of Jarmusch returning to the setting with different characters under different circumstances was one of the variations on a theme.\r\nThe film was shot in bright, primary colors rather than the black-and-white of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual languid pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as \"intuitive\". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of Reverse Shot as \"giving the impression of a failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis's glamor and try it on for size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context\". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch.\r\nMystery Train was the first American independent film to be financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC, and was produced on a budget \u2013 $2.8 million \u2013 that was considerable by Jarmusch's modest standards. The company was enthusiastic about underwriting the film despite the director insisting on retaining full creative control, and went on to fund his next three features. The substantial budget and time available gave Jarmusch the opportunity to shoot in color and to rehearse with the actors many scenes not in the script, including several from the courtship of Mitsuko and Jun. At a Memphis nightclub with the Japanese actors during production, the director had Masatoshi Nagase \u2013 who spoke little English but was an accomplished mimic \u2013 try chat-up lines on the female clientele as an acting exercise. Jarmusch took advantage of the production to make the second installment of his Coffee and Cigarettes series, a collection of short vignettes featuring acquaintances of the director sitting about drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The \"Memphis Version\", titled Twins, starred bickering twins Cinqu\u00e9 and Joie Lee alongside Steve Buscemi as an obtuse waiter who expounds his theory of Elvis having an evil twin to a hostile reception.\r\nRelease\r\n\u2014Luc Sante, Interview, November 1989.\r\nThe film had its domestic premiere at the 27th New York Film Festival in 1989, thereby emulating the director's previous features Stranger Than Paradise in 1984, and Down by Law in 1986. The Miami Herald declared it the \"quiet triumph\" of the festival. The film was picked up for theatrical distribution by Orion Classics in the United States, where it was released under an R-rating due to scenes featuring brief nudity and strong language. Its total domestic gross was $1,541,218, making it the 153rd highest-grossing film of 1989, and the 70th highest R-rated film of the year. Internationally, it was first shown in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival on May 13 and 14, 1989, and subsequently featured in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride and Toronto film festivals.\r\nMystery Train was released on DVD on March 28, 2000 with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1/2 surround sound. The DVD release was criticized by Anna Lazowski of allmovie who awarded it two stars out of five compared to four for the film itself, citing the paltry special features of 24 scene selections and a collectible behind-the-scenes booklet. A Criterion Collection DVD and Blu-ray were released on June 15, 2010, utilizing a new restored high-definition digital transfer.\r\nCritical reception\r\nLike Jarmusch's previous films, Mystery Train enjoyed a warm reception from critics. This was particularly evident at Cannes, where the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or and Jarmusch was commended for the festival's Best Artistic Achievement. It was nominated in six categories at the 1989 Independent Spirit Awards: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Jim Jarmusch), Best Director (Jim Jarmusch), Best Cinematography (Robby M\u00fcller), Best Actress (Youki Kudoh), and Best Supporting Actor (Steve Buscemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins).\r\nEntertainment Weekly reviewer Ira Robbins gave the film a B+ rating, complimenting it as \"conceptually ambitious\" and concluding that its \"offbeat characters, fine cinematography, and novel structure make for entertaining viewing\". Robert Fulford of The National Post hailed it as \"eccentric and deliriously funny\", while Rolling Stone's Phil Whitman remarked that the director's \"bracing, original comedy may be mostly smoke and air, but it's not insubstantial\". In The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it \"thoroughly fascinating, a delight\" and the director's best effort to date, drawing note to its retention of the \"same kind of dour, discordant charm\" exhibited by Stranger Than Paradise. He praised Jarmusch's development as a screenwriter \u2013 citing the restrained dialogue, humor and subtlety of the narrative and the careful construction of the plot \u2013 and the performances he elicited from the ensemble cast. John Hartl, in The Seattle Times, also drew a comparison with Stranger Than Paradise, judging Mystery Train to be the more accessible work while retaining the dry wit of its predecessor.\r\nHal Hinson of The Washington Post was unimpressed with the film, calling it Jarmusch's \"least engaging, and the first in which his bohemian posturing actually becomes an irritant\". Of the film's characters, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that some were \"beautifully imagined and realized, while others seem drawn from a more familiar stockpile, designed for reuse rather than discovery\". David Denby, concluding a mixed review of the film for New York Magazine, mused that \"one feels Jarmusch has pushed hipsterism and cool about as far as they can go, and that isn't nearly far enough.\" This reproach was echoed by other reviewers who found that the film's style did not stray far from that of the director's earlier work \u2013 a critical backlash that would be amplified two years later following the release of Night On Earth (1991).\r\nPostmodern cultural critic bell hooks cited the interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple as one of the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that \"he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look.\" He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was \"as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance\".\r\nExternal links\r\nMystery Train on IMDb\r\nMystery Train at Rotten Tomatoes\r\nMystery Train at The Jim Jarmusch Resource Page\r\n\"Communication Breakdown\" \u2013 an essay on the film from the Bright Lights Film Journal\r\nMystery Train: Memphis Blues Again an essay by Peter Guralnick at the Criterion Collection",

Jarmusch took advantage of the production to make the second installment of his Coffee and Cigarettes series, a collection of short vignettes featuring acquaintances of the director sitting about drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The \"Memphis Version\", titled Twins, starred bickering twins Cinqu\u00e9 and Joie Lee alongside Steve Buscemi as an obtuse waiter who expounds his theory of Elvis having an evil twin to a hostile reception.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>\u2014Luc Sante, Interview, November 1989.</p><p>The film had its domestic premiere at the 27th New York Film Festival in 1989, thereby emulating the director's previous features Stranger Than Paradise in 1984, and Down by Law in 1986. The Miami Herald declared it the \"quiet triumph\" of the festival. The film was picked up for theatrical distribution by Orion Classics in the United States, where it was released under an R-rating due to scenes featuring brief nudity and strong language. Its total domestic gross was $1,541,218, making it the 153rd highest-grossing film of 1989, and the 70th highest R-rated film of the year. Internationally, it was first shown in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival on May 13 and 14, 1989, and subsequently featured in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride and Toronto film festivals.</p><p>Mystery Train was released on DVD on March 28, 2000 with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1/2 surround sound. The DVD release was criticized by Anna Lazowski of allmovie who awarded it two stars out of five compared to four for the film itself, citing the paltry special features of 24 scene selections and a collectible behind-the-scenes booklet. A Criterion Collection DVD and Blu-ray were released on June 15, 2010, utilizing a new restored high-definition digital transfer.</p><br/><h3>Critical reception</h3><p>Like Jarmusch's previous films, Mystery Train enjoyed a warm reception from critics. This was particularly evident at Cannes, where the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or and Jarmusch was commended for the festival's Best Artistic Achievement. It was nominated in six categories at the 1989 Independent Spirit Awards: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Jim Jarmusch), Best Director (Jim Jarmusch), Best Cinematography (Robby M\u00fcller), Best Actress (Youki Kudoh), and Best Supporting Actor (Steve Buscemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins).</p><p>Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ira Robbins gave the film a B+ rating, complimenting it as \"conceptually ambitious\" and concluding that its \"offbeat characters, fine cinematography, and novel structure make for entertaining viewing\". Robert Fulford of The National Post hailed it as \"eccentric and deliriously funny\", while Rolling Stone's Phil Whitman remarked that the director's \"bracing, original comedy may be mostly smoke and air, but it's not insubstantial\". In The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it \"thoroughly fascinating, a delight\" and the director's best effort to date, drawing note to its retention of the \"same kind of dour, discordant charm\" exhibited by Stranger Than Paradise. He praised Jarmusch's development as a screenwriter \u2013 citing the restrained dialogue, humor and subtlety of the narrative and the careful construction of the plot \u2013 and the performances he elicited from the ensemble cast. John Hartl, in The Seattle Times, also drew a comparison with Stranger Than Paradise, judging Mystery Train to be the more accessible work while retaining the dry wit of its predecessor.</p><p>Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was unimpressed with the film, calling it Jarmusch's \"least engaging, and the first in which his bohemian posturing actually becomes an irritant\". Of the film's characters, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that some were \"beautifully imagined and realized, while others seem drawn from a more familiar stockpile, designed for reuse rather than discovery\". David Denby, concluding a mixed review of the film for New York Magazine, mused that \"one feels Jarmusch has pushed hipsterism and cool about as far as they can go, and that isn't nearly far enough.\" This reproach was echoed by other reviewers who found that the film's style did not stray far from that of the director's earlier work \u2013 a critical backlash that would be amplified two years later following the release of Night On Earth (1991).</p><p>Postmodern cultural critic bell hooks cited the interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple as one of the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that \"he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look.\" He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was \"as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance\".</p><br/><h3>External links</h3><ul><li>Mystery Train on IMDb</li><li>Mystery Train at Rotten Tomatoes</li><li>Mystery Train at The Jim Jarmusch Resource Page</li><li>\"Communication Breakdown\" \u2013 an essay on the film from the Bright Lights Film Journal</li><li>Mystery Train: Memphis Blues Again an essay by Peter Guralnick at the Criterion Collection</li></ul><br/>"
