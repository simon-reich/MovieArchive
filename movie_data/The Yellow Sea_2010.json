This film marks the reunion of the director and the lead actors who also first collaborated for the 2008 film The Chaser, in which Ha Jung-woo played the antagonist and Kim Yoon-seok played the protagonist. In The Yellow Sea, Ha Jung-woo plays the protagonist while Kim Yoon-seok plays the antagonist.\r\nThe film revolves around a cab driver who agrees to carry out a hit on a professor in exchange for getting his debts paid. He soon becomes a fugitive after the hit goes wrong, and is chased by both the police and the gangster who assigned him the task.\r\nThe Yellow Sea was released in South Korea on 22 December 2010.\r\nPlot\r\nIn northeastern Chinese city of Yanji in Yanbian Prefecture, Gu-nam (Ha Jung-woo), an ethnic Korean, or Joseonjok, toils away as a taxi driver. When not working, he is often found at gambling halls. Gu-nam is now in serious debt. His wife left to work in South Korea and promised to send money back. He has yet to hear from her and is tormented by nightmares of her having an extra-marital affair. To make matters worse, Gu-nam is fired from his job and debt collectors take most of his severance pay.\r\nLocal gangster, Myun Jung-hak (Kim Yoon-seok), offers him a deal: if Gu-nam goes to South Korea to kill a businessman, he will get CN\u00a557,000 (US$10,000). Gu-nam accepts and leaves for South Korea by train and a rickety fishing boat, with US$500 for expenses.\r\nWhen Gu-nam arrives in South Korea, he carefully scopes out his target for days, while also searching for his wife. When the time arrives for Gu-nam to take out his target, a string of unexpected events occurs, leaving him desperately looking for a way out. Meanwhile, the police, the South Korean mob, as well as the ethnic Korean Chinese mafia, all frantically search for Gu-nam.\r\nCast\r\nHa Jung-woo as Gu-nam\r\nKim Yoon-seok as Myun Jung-hak\r\nJo Sung-ha as Tae-won\r\nLee Chul-min as Choi Sung-nam\r\nKwak Do-won as Prof. Kim Seung-hyun\r\nLim Ye-won as Prof. Kim's wife\r\nTak Sung-eun as Gu-nam's wife\r\nKim Ki-hwan as Prof. Kim's driver\r\nKi Se-hyung as Tae-won's subordinate\r\nLee El as Joo-young, Tae-won's mistress\r\nOh Yoon-hong as Tae-won's wife\r\nJung Man-sik as Detective\r\nJung Min-sung as Detective\r\nKim Dong-hyun as Detective\r\nPark Byung-eun as bank employee\r\nJang So-yeon as employee at Do-man Hotel\r\nYang Ki-won as detective\r\nSung Byoung-sook as Gu-nam's mother\r\nKong Jung-hwan as Jeon Pil-kyoo\r\nBaek Won-gil as Korean-Chinese kidnapper 1\r\nKang Hyun-joong as Busan port sailor\r\nYoo Ha-bok as Yanbian taxi boss\r\nLee Hee-joon as policeman\r\nLee Jun-hyeok as dog seller 2\r\nKim Jae-hwa as Jung-hak's girlfriend (uncredited)\r\nRelease\r\nThe film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the 2011 Filmfest M\u00fcnchen.\r\nThe Australian and UK films rights were sold to Bounty Films.
