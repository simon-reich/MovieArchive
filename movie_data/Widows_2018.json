It received several award nominations, among them one for Davis for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.\r\nPlot\r\nHarry Rawlings and his criminal gang's getaway van are blown up during a police standoff after stealing $2 million from crime boss Jamal Manning. Jamal threatens Veronica, Harry\u2019s widow, demanding compensation, needing the money to finance his campaign for alderman of a South Side, Chicago ward. He is running against Jack Mulligan, the next-in-line of a dynastic family that has held the position for decades. Mulligan doesn't like politics, but is happy to profit from it.\r\nVeronica is given a key to a safety deposit box by Bash, Harry's loyal chauffeur, which contains Harry's notebook. Inside it is a detailed plan for stealing $5 million from Mulligan's home. She is advised to sell the notebook to Jamal's people, but decides against it.\r\nVeronica decides to carry out the heist, recruiting two of the other widows, Alice and Linda. Alice had lost her life of luxury and was forced by her mother to become a sugar baby. Linda lost her store, as her husband secretly gambled away the rent payments. The fourth widow, Amanda, does not join them, as Veronica discovers she has a 4-month-old baby. Alice acquires guns and a getaway van, while Linda deciphers Harry's blueprints. Jamal's brother Jatemme attacks several witnesses and kills Bash while looking for Harry's notebook. Eventually, Alice uses a real estate executive, her sugar daddy, to identify the blueprint as the safe room in Mulligan's home.\r\nLinda recruits Belle, her babysitter, to be the group's driver. Veronica visits Amanda and her baby, where she notices Harry's flask, indicating that Harry is likely alive and the father of Amanda's baby. Devastated, Veronica leaves without saying anything. It is revealed that Harry is alive and double crossed his crew by deliberately blowing up their getaway van. He is in league with Mulligan, to ruin Jamal's campaign. Returning home, Veronica opens the door to her son's room and relives the memory of his death (he was shot by police officers after being pulled over while driving). Veronica visits the Mulligan home and asks Jack for protection from the Mannings, but she's actually there to case the premises, while Belle scans the outdoor security.\r\nVeronica blackmails the CEO of the Mulligans' security company for the safe code, using incriminating photos left in Harry's notebook. The heist begins with Belle creating a disturbance down the street to draw the outside security detail away. Veronica and the others stun the lone security guard inside. Veronica, Linda and Alice reach the safe and retrieve the money. On their way out, Jack's father Tom appears, unmasks Veronica and shoots Alice, wounding her. Linda returns fire and kills Tom.\r\nThe women escape, but Jatemme appears and steals their van and money. The women chase him in another car, causing him to crash, killing him. They retrieve the money, then get Alice to the hospital. Veronica returns alone to their hideout, where Harry arrives to steal the money, needing $1 million of it to keep Mulligan quiet about his faked death. Harry claims that after the death of their son and subsequent disintegration of their marriage, he wanted to start over with Amanda and their child. Harry retrieves the money in the van, and turns to shoot Veronica \u2013 but Veronica kills him first.\r\nJack wins the position of alderman due to a sympathy vote following his father's murder. Linda reacquires her store, Alice sets up her own business, and Belle moves away. Veronica donates a large sum to rebuild a school library on the condition that it be named after her son Marcus. Outside of a diner, Veronica sees and warmly greets Alice.\r\nCast\r\nThe Widows\r\nViola Davis as Veronica, a Chicago teachers' union delegate and Harry's widow\r\nMichelle Rodriguez as Linda, a clothing store owner and Carlos's widow\r\nElizabeth Debicki as Alice, Florek's widow, who becomes a sugar baby to support herself after her husband's death\r\nCarrie Coon as Amanda, Jimmy's widow, who is not involved in Veronica's robbery scheme\r\nThe Husbands\r\nLiam Neeson as Harry Rawlings, a renowned bank robber who was Veronica's loving husband\r\nJon Bernthal as Florek, a member of Harry's gang who was Alice's abusive husband\r\nManuel Garcia-Rulfo as Carlos, a member of Harry's gang who was Linda's gambler husband\r\nCoburn Goss as Jimmy, a member of Harry's gang who was Amanda's husband\r\nThe Antagonists\r\nColin Farrell as Jack Mulligan, a politician who is mixed up in Veronica's plan\r\nRobert Duvall as Tom Mulligan, Jack's father and a power broker at odds with his son\r\nBrian Tyree Henry as Jamal Manning, a crime boss and politician who believes Veronica is indebted to him\r\nDaniel Kaluuya as Jatemme Manning, Jamal's brother and mob enforcer\r\nOther characters\r\nCynthia Erivo as Belle, a babysitter and beautician who looks after Linda's children and works with Veronica's group\r\nGarret Dillahunt as Bash Babiak, Harry and Veronica's chauffeur\r\nJacki Weaver as Agnieska, Alice's abusive mother\r\nLukas Haas as David, a real estate developer with whom Alice develops a transactional sexual relationship following Florek's death\r\nMatt Walsh as Ken, the CEO of a security company\r\nKevin J.

The soundtrack, released by Milan Records, includes the score as well as songs by Nina Simone, and the Cool Kids, as well as a new song \"The Big Unknown\" by Sade later released as a single.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018. It was released in the United States on November 16, 2018.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nWidows grossed $42.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $33.6 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $76 million, against a production budget of $42 million.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, Widows was released alongside Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald and Instant Family, and was projected to gross $12\u201318 million from 2,803 theaters in its opening weekend. It grossed $4.2 million on its first day, including $600,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up making $12.3 million over the weekend, finishing fifth at the box office. Deadline Hollywood stated that the low debut was because of a \"lack of urgency\" in the advertising, and that the studio should not have relied on the good reviews alone to sell the film. Other publications, including Business Insider, said the film should have been released outside the busy November frame, and that the perceived marketing toward specifically African-American audiences, and its R-rating, limited the film's appeal. In its second weekend, the film dropped 33% to $8.2 million (and $10.5 million total over the five-day Thanksgiving frame), finishing eighth, and then made $4.4 million in its third weekend.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 396 reviews, with an average rating of 8.11/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Widows rounds up a stellar ensemble for a heist thriller that mixes popcorn entertainment with a message \u2013 and marks another artistic leap for director Steve McQueen.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars; social media monitor RelishMix noted online responses to the film were \"mixed\".\r\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety praised McQueen's direction and Davis's performance and wrote, \"The strongest aspect of Widows is the way the movie gets us \u2014 and keeps us \u2014 rooting for its desperate-living heroines. They're past the point of just wanting to have fun (the subtext of almost every heist movie); they're less concerned with comeuppance than sheer survival.\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an \"A-\", saying the film \"works as well as it does due to the way McQueen juggles substance with entertainment value to such eager subversive ends. The movie engages with topics as complex as sexism, police brutality, and interracial marriage, but it still delivers on the car chases and gunplay. No superhero movie digs this deep.\" Dirty Movies considered it one of the best films of 2018, describing it as McQueen's best work since Hunger. Representing more critical views, Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"C+\", arguing that it's \"not clear exactly what kind of movie(s) Widows wants to be\" and that it feels like a \"crazy-quilt patchwork of other, better films\".\r\nAccolades\r\nTop ten lists\r\nWidows was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists for 2018, among them:\r\n1st \u2013 Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times\r\n1st \u2013 David Sims, The Atlantic\r\n2nd \u2013 Vinnie Mancuso, The Globe and Mail\r\n3rd \u2013 Matthew Jacobs, The Huffington Post\r\n3rd \u2013 Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York\r\n4th \u2013 Tim Grierson, Screen Daily\r\n5th \u2013 Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com\r\n5th \u2013 Mark Olsen, Los Angeles Times\r\n6th \u2013 Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune\r\n6th \u2013 Jason Guerrasio, Business Insider\r\n6th \u2013 Kristen Lopez, RogerEbert.com\r\n7th \u2013 Christopher Orr, The Atlantic\r\n7th \u2013 Marlow Stern, The Daily Beast\r\n8th \u2013 Jesse Hassenger, The A.V.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Widows rounds up a stellar ensemble for a heist thriller that mixes popcorn entertainment with a message \u2013 and marks another artistic leap for director Steve McQueen.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars; social media monitor RelishMix noted online responses to the film were \"mixed\".</p><p>Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised McQueen's direction and Davis's performance and wrote, \"The strongest aspect of Widows is the way the movie gets us \u2014 and keeps us \u2014 rooting for its desperate-living heroines. They're past the point of just wanting to have fun (the subtext of almost every heist movie); they're less concerned with comeuppance than sheer survival.\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an \"A-\", saying the film \"works as well as it does due to the way McQueen juggles substance with entertainment value to such eager subversive ends. The movie engages with topics as complex as sexism, police brutality, and interracial marriage, but it still delivers on the car chases and gunplay. No superhero movie digs this deep.\" Dirty Movies considered it one of the best films of 2018, describing it as McQueen's best work since Hunger. Representing more critical views, Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"C+\", arguing that it's \"not clear exactly what kind of movie(s) Widows wants to be\" and that it feels like a \"crazy-quilt patchwork of other, better films\".</p><br/><h3>Accolades</h3><h4>Top ten lists</h4><p>Widows was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists for 2018, among them:</p><ul><li>1st \u2013 Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times</li><li>1st \u2013 David Sims, The Atlantic</li><li>2nd \u2013 Vinnie Mancuso, The Globe and Mail</li><li>3rd \u2013 Matthew Jacobs, The Huffington Post</li><li>3rd \u2013 Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York</li><li>4th \u2013 Tim Grierson, Screen Daily</li><li>5th \u2013 Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com</li><li>5th \u2013 Mark Olsen, Los Angeles Times</li><li>6th \u2013 Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune</li><li>6th \u2013 Jason Guerrasio, Business Insider</li><li>6th \u2013 Kristen Lopez, RogerEbert.com</li><li>7th \u2013 Christopher Orr, The Atlantic</li><li>7th \u2013 Marlow Stern, The Daily Beast</li><li>8th \u2013 Jesse Hassenger, The A.V.
